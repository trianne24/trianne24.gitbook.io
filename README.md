# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Pat.

Hi, my name is Patricia Joanne and I am an Informatics student at Padjadjaran University. I am a person who likes to express my stories and interests in blogs. I use this Gitbook to tell my life in college including the time when I work for committees, organizations, and even internships. I also do food and entertainment reviews sometimes. Gitbook is not comfortable for a blog but I still like it because it's light and easy to use.

Before reading my blog posts, you may consider these posts to get to know me better:

* [History of my life experiences](get/histories.md)
* [Informatics related projects I've done](get/informatics.md)
* [List of my active social media accounts](get/contacts.md)

Thank you for visiting my blog!
