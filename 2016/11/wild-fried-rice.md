# Wild Fried Rice

Today is like another food hunting day as usual but we (Mila and I) had such a lot of problems to face. First, there was Ocho Cinco meeting, who asked us to come to Bayu’s temporary home to eat legit cake. Err… not legit but ‘legit’. WTF I don’t know what is “kue lapis legit” in English ah forget it. (Just googling and found it’s sweet layer cake in English. Damn I thought it’s more difficult -\_-) Of course we couldn’t make it because we had our own activities to do. Then, today Mila was having leadership training in her department so our food hunting activity was cancelled. But she asked me if I wanted to order food while she came back and easily I asked for fried rice. Fyi, fried rice is my all time favorite home-cook food. When I don’t have a mood to try new taste, I’d rather order fried rice instead.

After that, I just did my homework and jobs while waiting for my food came. Guess what time when it arrived? About 10 PM. Thanks God I was still hungry in that time even I had a little bit stomachache. And I ate… slowly… because it’s so hot!! Btw, why do “panas” and “pedas” have a same meaning in English? Ok so I chose “wild” instead to describe “pedas”. Yes, it’s not ordinary wild. It’s so wild! You can see it on the photo. Even it’s already empty but the Styrofoam itself still looked wild. I’m so done with wild foods -\_-
