# A Slice of Disappointment

About few days ago, a new Domino’s pizza franchise has opened in Jatinangor and because it’s still new there’s a nice promo to check. Yup, 50% discount for all pizzas! Err.. not all I think, some crust types don’t get discount. Ok, so this promo is still available but I’m enough to try once. Why? This time I wanna tell.

This promo was spread over every Padjadjaran’s students including my family group Ocho Cinco. Firstly we wanted to pay-joint (patungan) a box of pizza but we couldn’t meet up together in that time so only the boys who ate the pizza. Mila, my food hunter friend, asked me to pay-joint a box of pizza, no cancel again right now. Of course I accepted her desire because it’s also my desire LOL. But there were no more who wanted to pay-joint again, just Mila and me. Actually Arum firstly also wanted to pay-joint but once again she cancelled. Because Mila and I couldn’t wait again so we just bought it today. We didn’t order it, we directly went to the pizza shop. We had to wait for a long line because yeah, the promo thing. In the waiting time, even Mila took photos of her in the pizza shop because its interior looked good.

After waiting, we got the box of pizza and went to our lovely temporary home fast. And when we opened the box… WTF are you kidding me? The pizzas looked so not measured well. The toppings were also not full. Whatever, just eat them. Before that, we took this photo of the pizzas and shared it to Ocho Cinco, yeah wanna show off our pizza.

Ok that’s it. I considered this pizza as the first and the last hedonism food I ate. Yeah because even it’s discounted, the pizza is not worth it as the price.
