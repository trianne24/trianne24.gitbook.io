This event was also an event to community service like [C-TOS](c-tos-2016.md) before, but this was coming from Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty freshmen. WACANA stands for “Mewarnai dan Membaca di Jatinangor”(?) I didn’t really remember the exact name. As the name of the event, this event was a coloring competition for primary schools’ students in Jatinangor. The coloring pictures that they should color were contained with Indonesian legends or myths to read. Actually, that’s the primary purpose: making young generations love to read. As we can see today, young generations prefer to play gadgets than read. Our country won’t be better if our young generations don’t like reading.

So before the event was held, as usual we created the committees. I’ve got myself as the secretary who had to make letters and proposals. Psstt… my partner in crime Audya was being the head of the event LOL. Yeah he was really my partner in crime because I always be with him every time. Same group of MNS One, same village for OKK, and also same HITS class! Let’s describe one by one, shall we? MNS One is the name of student orientation for Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty freshmen and from this event too we had to do this WACANA event. So basically we got a task to do community service event with our groups and WACANA was our community service event name. MNS One stands for Mathematics and Natural Sciences One (MIPA Bersatu). LOL English changed everything. Then OKK is one of college subjects about going to villages in Jatinangor and do community service. Last, HITS class is a class group consisted freshmen from same faculty and studying together for one semester.

Back to topic, after creating the committees, we did our own jobs. Such as creating poster for publications and documentations division, doing survey to primary schools in Jatinangor for public relations division, etc. And today, we held this event in Cikeruh Public Primary School 1 (SDN Cikeruh 1) with Cikeruh PPS 1 and 2’s students as the participants. After that, we announced the winners and gave the prizes to the winners. That’s all.

I had to admit, because of this event committees, I became close with Audya LOLOLOLOL. You know, before this event was held, he was only someone I knew, not a friend for me. But now, he is really my partner in crime especially in HITS class. Please don’t tell him I’m gossiping him here haha.
