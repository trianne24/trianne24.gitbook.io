# C-TOS 2016

C-TOS or Cyber (Informatics) Goes to School is my first committee in my college life. This event was held as a community service (pengabdian masyarakat) from my generation Cyber 2016 in Informatics Engineering. That’s why this event is about teaching IT to future generations especially Word, Excel, and Power Point.

I’ve got myself in event organizing division. This division has a job to set the timeline of the event, time-keeping so the event starts and ends on time, and of course be the MC in the event. Everything was prepared from about less than two weeks ago.

And now, today on October 1st, 2016 we held this event in PGRI JHS 1 (SMP PGRI 1) Jatinangor. I got a job as the MC, partnered with Fauzi who was also from event organizing division. Well, the event was going smoothly as our plan even though in the beginning we had some problem in time-keeping.

Thanks to you guys, Cyber 2016, who made this event succeed. Also thanks to the students from PGRI JHS 1 who were already being good participants for this event. See you in our department in the future maybe?
