One of our department’s best program is IFest, or Informatics Festival. This program has three events, there are football competition, national seminar, and concert as the closing ceremony. So today me and my generation Cyber 2016 is joining IFest National Seminar 2016 in Moestopo Hall, Communication Science Faculty. This seminar has a theme: “Technology Innovations to Build Smarter Communities” and invited some success people in technology. They are Mochamad Ridwan Kamil (Mayor of Bandung),  Anton Gustoni (West Java’s Head of Communications and Informations Department), Onno W. Purbo (IT expert), Setiaji (Head of Jakarta Smart City), Rama Raditya (CEO of Qlue and Terralogiq Integrasi Solusi), and Daniel Oscar Baskoro (Innovation Project Assistant). Actually I only know Ridwan Kamil LOL. But as my dedication to my department and wanna try something new, so I decided to join this seminar.

My opinion about this seminar? Awesome! By listening to those interviewees, I imagined myself being success like them. That’s why I love being a scholar in Informatics Engineering, because it’s really my passion. But unfortunately I didn’t see Ridwan Kamil coming today. Also the seminar was too long so some of my friends were bored and slept. I can’t deny that, I was also bored in the seminar so I did something to make me still awake. Yes, taking photos of my friends sleeping LOL. My generation’s LINE group has a photo album containing photos of our sleeping time. Look stupid enough for laughs. In Indonesia, we say it “aib”. From this seminar, me and some prankish friends got a lot of sleeping photos of our friends. What an achievement, right? Haha.
