# Making Mushy Spaghetti

First, I want to tell that even though this post is in “Perbaikan gizi” category or in English we say as nutrition improving in my temporary home (kost), the reality that will be happened is opposite of it.

I’ve been living in my temporary home just about a month and I’ve already been tired order foods so I want to be a good ‘kost survivor’ by trying something new like today. A few days ago, I bought uncooked spaghetti from a supermarket. Of course I also bought the ready-to-eat spaghetti sauce. And now it’s time to cook it.

My temporary home has a kitchen but I don’t think I want to share my food to others hahaha so I decided to cook it in my own room by using rice cooker. Btw, rice cooker is one of useful thing that should you have while living in temporary home. Because it’s not just for cooking rice, it’s multifunction! One of the example is this: cooking spaghetti LOL.

I had to admit that I hated waiting the spaghetti to be limp to stir. I didn’t count how much time wasted for waiting it. I even could do some works and went to somewhere while waiting the spaghetti. Of course I didn’t expect something bad will happen to my spaghetti because I was really sure I did everything right.

Oh my, did I tell you when did I cook it? In the night! And when it’s cooked, it’s already too late for eating. So I decide to keep the spaghetti for my lunch tomorrow. I’ve also spare some for my dinner tomorrow because the portion is enough for more than one.

THAT’S WHEN I REALIZED I DID SOMETHING UNFORGIVEN.

I left my cooked spaghetti in the rice cooker along with the boiled water. And guess what happened in the next day?

My. Precious. Spaghetti. Is. Too. Mushy. (Spaghetti aing jadi lembek pisan.)

Still wanna try to eat, so I keep bringing it for my lunch. And I cancel my plan to save for my dinner but I better eat it for my breakfast so it doesn’t get worse  in night.

This is the photo of the disaster.

Okay. I’m done of spaghetti. No more (mushy) spaghetti again. Ever.
