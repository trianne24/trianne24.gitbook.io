# A Slice of Happiness

Hello again with another slice of pizza to tell. I don’t know what word to describe this day. Exhausting, awesome, and lovely are mixed into one mood right now. Let’s just begin the story.

Yesterday is my classmate Abie’s birthday and I congratulated him silently via LINE message. After that, Abie thanked me by promising to treat me pizza in Pizza Hut, only for me and Iyon. But because yesterday was a holiday, so he treated us today. Oh yes, Iyon is Abie’s best friend and my favorite driver(?) I don’t know but since I found out his embarrassing childhood and annoyed him sometimes I became close with him and even asked him to ride me to college. Fine, let’s back to the story.

Actually today is still holiday for those who are in class A because the final test that should be scheduled today is cancelled. By the way Abie, Iyon, and me are from class A. Even though I knew from yesterday that today is still holiday for me but I still went to college. For free WiFi in library of course. Haha. Another reason was I didn’t want to be trouble when we went together to Jatos (Jatinangor Square) because we agreed to meet up in campus when lunch time or about 2 PM. I waited and waited for them and even my friends from class B had already gone home but they both didn’t come. Seriously it’s getting on my nerves and I thought this would be cancelled so I left campus and joined some my girl friends studying for the next final exam: algorithm and programming in Dapoer Roti Bakar.

It’s already 7 PM and they still didn’t show up so I decided to visit one of my girl friend Niya’s temporary home and took a nap. Just about overslept, suddenly Iyon called me and asked where I was. LOL I was shocked not just because he contacted me first but also the treat wasn’t cancelled.

After that, Iyon rode me to Abie’s temporary home which was near Jatos then we walked together to Jatos. Actually we went to Abie’s temporary home first because Iyon didn’t want to spend money for parking his motorcycle in Jatos. WTF. And yeah finally we enjoyed our pizza and surely it’s better than the pizza that I ate before as you can see in [this post](../11/a-slice-of-disappointment.md) LOL. Okay I sounded like I never eat Pizza Hut but I had to admit it’s not wrong too right? While in Jatinangor I never taste heaven like this. And also when in Jakarta, I didn’t always eat pizza so I didn’t remember how it tasted.

Ah, it’s not just because I was treated pizza today but I also could study with Iyon. Damn, he disappeared this morning because he was visiting Dio’s temporary home to study, sleep, and play game. And because he had already told Abie and me that reason, he paid us with what he had already studied this morning. So this morning he studied about logic informatics that should be our test today if it’s not cancelled. But the material that he studied was far from our material because he studied about class B’s material! I didn’t understand, why our class and class B studied different material even though the subject was logic informatics too. Fine, I was so speechless of Iyon’s confession that he didn’t only study class B’s material but also class B’s logic informatics final test which was tested this morning! WTF. GOD BLESS YOU DUDE. Yeah, even though Abie and me studied what Iyon studied this morning, I doubted our cancelled test would be same like class B’s. But that’s okay, there’s no loss by learning something new.

Then whoa we reached 10 PM and Jatos was almost closed so we went back to Abie’s temporary home then finally I got home by Iyon’s. What a long day. Thanks to you both Abie and Iyon for today!
