# Midnight With A Hungry Cat

This night is as usual as the other nights. Silent, but not so really. Cold, but too hot to wear jacket. And WiFi connection is bad as always. Welcome to my temporary home: Wisma Mayangsari.

This time I don’t want to tell how I got this temporary home. It’s so long and I’m so tired with English language. But today I want to just randomly chit-chat to you guys. Sooo… This temporary home has two WiFi hotspot. The first one is Kertco and the other one is Office. I lived in Room Number 26, which is only can connect to Kertco while inside my room. If I want to connect to Office I have to go out of my room. Unfortunately, rooms which can only connect to Kertco are not only mine, but almost every rooms in this temporary home! Damn it. That’s why I often face this annoying problem: limited access to Kertco. If that problem comes, I really have to go out of my room because I don’t have any internet quota LOL.

Tonight, I read my LINE chats outside my room to get WiFi connection to Office. I took my short chair outside so I didn’t have to stand up while using WiFi outside. Beside me, I saw a hungry cat was searching for foods in trash bin. Such a naughty cat. She/he made the trash bin fell and looked messy.

But luckily she/he was so cute so I took a photo of her/him. And when I direct my phone to her/him, she/he showed a shocked face like she/he was caught of being criminal LOL. After I sent her/his photo to my generation group, she/he just left me and the trash bin untidy. Haha what an irresponsible cat.
