# Honey Doughnuts as Dinner

Choosing Sayang Street as my temporary home location is one of the best choice that I’ve even chosen. Why not? In this street, there are lots of delicious foods being sold. One of them is honey doughnut. Maybe you think this food is normal but I think it’s unique LOL. Okay let’s talk about how was my first time tasting honey doughnuts.

So today, my temporary home’s neighbor Mila asked my help to do her reports. She is in Biology major btw, and she got not so easy homework to do. We had to go to COPA, a place where we can print or photocopy tasks, again and again. Not just that, I had to help her do the stubborn formatting in her report. Mila even almost got despair of her reports until she got good news in her LINE notification. The deadline of her reports was postponed! She was really happy and soo she treated me and herself with some honey doughnuts. Actually she was the only one who understood my desire to these foods.

And here they are. Honey doughnuts as dinner, because we too focus on doing reports so didn’t notice the time is already too night to eat something heavy.
