# Anti Cockroaches Window

Cockroach is a living thing that even men can’t resist, especially when that creature flies. I’m not afraid of cockroach, but I feel disgusted seeing it in my room. I didn’t even know why they could go inside my room, because it’s also impossible if they came from my toilet. My toilet hole is closed and can’t be opened duh.

One day, I realized where those disgusting creatures come. They come from above my door and windows! Yeah, in fact all rooms in my temporary home have a gap above the door and the windows. I don’t know why. It’s really dangerous I think, not only cockroaches can fly through there, but also mosquitoes. Then my engineering head thought a stupid idea for this problem.

Paper? No, they’re not just ordinary paper, they’re my old notes. Instead throwing unused notes to trash bin, I made them for covering the gaps. And as you can see above, we got anti cockroaches window now! Now I can sleep peacefully without any cockroach get into my room.
