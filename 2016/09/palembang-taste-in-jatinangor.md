# Palembang Taste in Jatinangor

Another reason to live in Sayang Street, we could taste Sumatran and Javanese culinary here LOL. Fyi, mostly we could find Padang rice here. So far, I like Padang rice except its green chili sauce\(?\) and its boiled kale \(kangkung rebus?\). Besides that, we also could found a lot of wagon’s fried rice which is always tasted better than our handmade. Ah, enough telling some foods here, this time I wanna share about Palembang taste in Jatinangor, precisely in Sayang Street. What’s that? Of course, Pempek!

Pempek is not a rare variety of food actually but I’m surprised that I could find it too in Jatinangor, a rural area. I’m telling you, even we could find pandan martabak and ramen here. But I forgot to take the picture for those LOL.

Okay, this kind of story is always and will always be in night, because only in nights I can explore Jatinangor freely from everyday’s business in college. This night Mila and I, had pempek for our dinner. Haha, you notice something again? I didn’t realize it until now, Mila and I became a food hunter team every night. Psst… don’t tell her I’m gossiping her here.

So here it is, the Palembang taste in Jatinangor. Actually, the pempek store is going to close when we got to there. That’s why the pempek that we bought is only a few as you can see. And don’t be autofocus with those cucumbers\(?\) because I just don’t like them okay ahaha.
