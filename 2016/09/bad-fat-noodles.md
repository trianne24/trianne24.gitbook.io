# Bad Fat Noodles

Before telling the chronology, I better tell you about Ocho Cinco family. This family was created when I got assignment to make vlog about Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty’s buildings before college life started. The assignment required a group with 10 freshmen from 5 or more departments in Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty. Not taking so long time, I teamed up with my two neighbors in temporary home, Mila and Arum, plus 7 more people again: Puput, Regi, Fahmi, Alif, Ihsan, Nando, and Bayu.

Even though our assignment was done a long time ago, but we still keep contacting each other. One of our tradition is celebrating other’s birthday. And today, we were celebrating Bayu’s birthday in his temporary home. The surprise would be horrible if his ex girlfriend who came from far away (somewhere in Bandung) helped us making this surprise. There were also his mom coming to surprise him. Because of his mom we could eat a lot of delicious foods. And even she treated us too with these BAD FAT noodles.

Yes, really bad. But we don’t care as long as those are free LOL. While we were ordering and eating those noodles, Bayu was busy with his ex girlfriend because she had to come back home. So now talking about the noodles shall we? Those noodles we ordered from Instamie, a noodles stall near from Padjadjaran University. Honestly, I don’t like the price because even though there are delicious but I have to realize that noodles are noodles. And noodles aren’t that expensive. They are expensive because of the additional ingredients like eggs, sausages, etc. as you can see in the photo. Fyi, the noodles that we ordered were tom yum and cheesy flavor. We only ordered two plates because we thought one plate is more than for one portion. And we already ate a lots too when we were still in Bayu’s temporary home.

Ugh, I swear this has to be the first and the last time I’m eating those bad fats noodles or else I will always feel guilty eating noodles. Noodles are such a staple food for kost survivors, but I don’t think it’s good to be eaten everyday too. Maybe just occasionally.
