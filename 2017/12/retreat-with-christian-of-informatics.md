# Retreat with Christian of Informatics

This would be a great history for Christians of Informatics, a community of Christian people from Informatics Engineering Department in Padjadjaran University, because finally we could organize Retreat this year. Several days before I uploaded [Imazine](../11/imazine-4.md), I was asked by Senior Evita to join the committee for organizing the Retreat. I just had to make designs like the community official logo and the invitation letter. I couldn’t refuse but I was so sorry that I didn’t finish my job here. The logo I made was not good and I couldn’t make the invitation letter because I was still busy. Luckily the other committees were understand with my condition. They still welcomed to me. By the way, I didn’t really know the positions of every committees so I just mentioned them okay. There were Santo as the project officer, Senior Gilnus as the Christian of Informatics leader, Senior Eben as the steering committee \(idk maybe it just because he was the oldest senior\), Agnes, Benedict, Senior Evita, Senior Yoshe, and Senior Yemima.

I never went to the meeting because of my other business but on day-1 before the event, I finally could make it. In the meeting I was so jobless LOL. I even sang randomly with Agnes, Santo, Senior Gilnus, and Senior Eben while Senior Evita and Senior Yoshe were making the event rundown.

The next day, on December 8th 2017 we gathered on the afternoon and went together to the hostel. The night was already coming when we arrived so the girls were directly going to prepare the dinner. It was my first time cutting onions and this was really like a new life achievement for me. Just only a few tutorial and I was already becoming pro. There were nugget, satay, fried tofu, tempe, and fried mushroom served all in the carpet for our dinner.

After the dinner, we did a worship to Jesus and sharing time by the seniors. Maybe this year’s retreat wasn’t joined by all members of our community but at least there was one representation every generations. The sharing time was brought by Senior Edrick from 2012 generation, Senior Eben from 2013 generation, and Senior Leo from 2014 generation. They had their own unique past time and I almost couldn’t believe that my life was still better than them. Thank God you made my life beautiful and now I knew that You was always with me every time. Finally the sharing time finished and we had free time before sleep. We were playing Werewolf game three times. Every round had it own stories behind that and it became our precious memories even after the retreat was over. The girls were also taking photos together. Because there were only 5 of us so we were getting close easily.

The next morning, because almost everyone woke up late, the girls were directly preparing for the lunch. We served noodles, nugget, fried tofu, and tempe. After lunch we did a worship again and then we played games. The host of the games were Senior Evita and Senior Yoshe. There were many team games that we played. My team was lost but it was okay because everyone still looked happy. We took a silly photo together after that.

After that we were packing our luggage because we would go back to our places. Once again, we took a family photo again. Well, this time the photo looked better LOL.

And that’s how I ended this retreat. I hoped next year we could organize retreat again with more people joined and better activities!
