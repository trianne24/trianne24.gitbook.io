# Dirarasa Project

I was shocked when suddenly Senior Midun wanted to meet him. He asked me to join him making PKM (Program Kreativitas Mahasiswa) or Students Creative Program with Senior Rio too. Actually I wanted to refuse it because I wasn’t interested in making PKM. At that time I also had a required project to make PKM for Entrepreneurship subject. But because Senior Midun said I just had to help him making designs I accepted it. Designing was already my passion for everything. Even though making PKM was still new for me, it’s okay I only did what I had to do.

Our PKM idea was in “Karsa Cipta” category. We will make an Android application about learning Sundanese old letters. For the proposal I only had to make the mock ups of the app as you can see below.

In the middle of making the proposal, I was asked to help them making the budget funds. I was very shocked when I heard that this PKM thing would make a lot of money if we could pass. I just knew why Senior Midun was really passionated making PKM as much as he wanted until he could pass. He never passed any PKM proposal and this time he really wanted to pass before he would graduate. It wasn’t necessary if we didn’t make the app as long as the fresh money was already on our hands. This project wasn’t like a competition that had to be showed off the app after being passed.

Finally after several days, today we uploaded the PKM proposal to the official PKM website. I hope this time Senior Midun will be lucky and I can be more interested of making PKM proposals later.
