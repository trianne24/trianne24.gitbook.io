Today it’s not usual for me to wake up early in the morning because yeah I’m a nocturnal human LOL. But why don’t we try something new in holiday? That’s why I chose to go to this event.

It’s new for me because it’s the first time I went to University of Indonesia and the first time used commuter line train. A day before today, I went to station to survey how I got the ticket and how I got to University of Indonesia. I also had already asked my friend Septia which was a student in University of Indonesia about this commuter line train. I even asked if she wanted to accompany me in the train. But unfortunately she couldn’t come with me. It’s okay, I went by myself.

Soooo… this morning I went to the station with my father then I bought the ticket by myself. The ticket was the e-card like I showed above. It’s only for a day trip so I should turn it back before I came back home in the same station I bought. Then I went inside the station. At first I wasn’t sure which train I should take so I missed about 2-3 trains to make sure myself. Finally I took the train and arrived safely in University of Indonesia. In front of the station’s exit gate I met Senior Ojan which also joined this event. By the way, he was a Bandung citizen so a day before today he stayed over in his relation’s house just because he really wanted to go to this event -\_-

I went to the venue along with him. Well, I didn’t know where’s the venue and he said he knew the venue. Ah it’s pretty awkward to walk with him. I didn’t know why, maybe because we haven’t met for a long time? Finally we reached the venue but we were too early. The event hadn’t been ready yet so we talked something to chill the atmosphere(?) I happened to see Senior Atep who was also joining this event and made him to sit closer with us. Then Anbiya and Ibnu also came to sit with us. Yes, they’re the people from Padjadjaran University’s Informatics Engineering. Actually there should be Shofi too but she couldn’t go suddenly because she had to go to MTQ competition in Malang.

The event started. It’s a seminar about Google Assistant, TensorFlow, and Kotlin. The speakers of this seminar were three experts which you could see on the poster at the very first line of this post. I thought the first two topics were exciting but no for the last topic. The last topic was about Kotlin which was a programming language that I didn’t understand so I couldn’t be focused to the presentation.

In the end of the event, there was a doorprize game. Anbiya won the Google t-shirt from this game. After that we took a group photo with the speakers and went out from the venue. I got snacks and HokBen from this event. LOL this seminar was free and I got free foods. Such a good event. I ate the foods with those four guys from Padjadjaran University’s Informatics Engineering. Then we went back home. Ibnu, which lived not far from University of Indonesia, went back home by his motorcycle. Others including me were going home by using commuter line train. It was more crowded inside the train compared with the morning train. After arriving in my station, I went out of the train and went back home by public car and walked.

Yes, that’s all for today’s activities. I literally had already tried two new things today. By the way I lied at the first paragraph :p I chose to go to this event not because I wanted to try something new but because I wanted the certificate of this event LOL.
