Finally today is coming. Guess what? The closing of Instagram event! Ahhh I really waited for this moment. I was tired for being a morning person every weekends and how I was always scared because hearing shouts for medics. I swore I never wanted to do like this again.

Okay, let’s talk about the closing event. The name is Nuit de l’Art Amaryllis. I didn’t know why they named the event too difficult to say. But as long as I knew, it started from last year’s Instagram closing event which name was Nuit de l’Art Orchid. Yes, it will be always flower in the end of the name.

I had to admit I was lucky to be medic division so I didn’t really have a job for today. I mostly enjoyed as an audience rather than a committee. I only helped the publication and documentation division once to print some properties for decoration.

The event showed all art category competitions. The first one was Mister and Miss Himatif. The participants had to show their talents and then got a random question which was asked by the judges. The next one was solo vocal. This competition was for male and female so it meant each generation sent two representatives. There were also song covering competition which was only performed by the winner group. Don’t forget to mention photography competition which was I also joined besides chess competition, but this event only showed the photos to see.

Not all about Instagram, but this event was a collaboration between Talent and Interest Department and Research and Development Department. There were also Coin winners announcement! Remember when I joined the infographic design competition? Yeah, but I didn’t wish for winning because I knew the seniors would. My designing skill still couldn’t be described as professional. By the way, I forgot to tell about this in my post about Coin. Actually Iyon couldn’t use any of designing software like Photoshop or Illustrator but he was good when designing in video editing software. Such an anti mainstream person right? Unfortunately he couldn’t use video editing software for the competition so he forced to use Photoshop. I remembered at the moment he watched tutorials on YouTube and made him couldn’t finish his infographic poster. Although he was still a Photoshop beginner, I saw a very good potential in him. Damn, his unfinished poster was awesome. I really hate you dude.

Let’s back to the topic. After that, the event also had Instagram winners announcement from sports, e-sports, and arts category competitions. The prize was just a bunch of snacks and a trophy for the 1st winner. I got a bunch for winning 2nd place in female chess battle and a certificate for joining Coin competitions.

Ahhh the event ended in midnight or over. But I couldn’t directly go home because I was one of the committee. Tonight we had the last time of Instagram committee evaluation. Whoa I couldn’t believe finally it’s over. Even though I mostly didn’t enjoy my position in Instagram committee, I was still happy for being one of them. Because of Instagram, I could know more and befriend with some seniors in Informatics Engineering. Also I sensed this one was a training for me to wake up early every weekends. Umm actually I didn’t hate because I had to wake up early every weekends but I couldn’t wash my clothes OMG.
