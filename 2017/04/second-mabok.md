# Second Mabok?

New day came and new month started. It’s March 1st and it meant we had to change the wall magazine. I meant MIPA’s Board of Information aka Mabok \(Majalah Tembok\). This month concept was trying to copy the template of our posters in social accounts. By the way, we have already had our grand design for this year’s cabinet. I’ve already showed it in the previous post.

Okay so that day we started to make this month’s wall magazine. Yeah we only completed the wall magazine about 50% of it.

So far it looked nice, but I have to say this guys, it didn’t survive for a long time. Btw this is an update.

As you can see in that picture, some of the papers and the articles were fallen. We’ve already fixed it several times but it fell over again. Even some people who walked past the wall magazine board helped to fix it too. LOL. I remembered my friend took a photo of some kind strangers fixed the wall magazine. Finally Senior Tiar decided to buy a big plastic for covering the board. This was the last condition of our wall magazine.

That’s it for this month. Oh yes, one more. We didn’t update anything for April. All of the staffs even the head of department Senior Tiar were busy because of the midterm tests. I had to admit I was disappointed for the skipped update and I’ve already said above that we only completed 50% so we missed a lot for March and April.

Phew, okay. This really needs an evaluation for next month.
