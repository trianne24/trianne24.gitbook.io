# Aftershock

Did I ever tell how much I love my temporary home? I LOVE ALL IN IT! Err… I mean during I lived here. Yeah I know some stories to beware for theft or fraud by its own residents. Or how sometimes the wifi hotspot couldn’t be connected at all. But I believe there won’t be another good temporary home keepers which are always caring the residents like their own children. I also loved how big my temporary home is and a lot of cats which are always hanging around when I go outside or back to my room.

Ah you should also know how patient the temporary home keepers here. They are Mister Uwot and his wife but I don’t know the name. Let me tell you how naughty I am but they are still caring me as well. Today I made a small accident but such a big problem. I broke my cable roll and made the electricity of the house down.

I didn’t know at first, I thought the smell of something burnt was from the garbage which were burnt in front of my room by Mister Uwot. But I was wrong. Suddenly there was a lightning in my room from my cable roll then the lights off. Not only in my room but all rooms in the house. At first I didn’t want to tell Mister Uwot or his wife about this but when they reached my room to ask my condition, I couldn’t hide it again. Thankfully Mister Uwot helped me to fix my burnt cable roll. I thought I should buy a new cable roll but wow he could fix it without any electro engineering skill! Just cut down the burnt part then connected the cable again.

That was one of the problems I have ever made in this house which I told you because it happened today. I didn’t remember other problems, maybe because I forgot to type it down when it happened.
