# Trying to ‘Hedon’ For Stupid Reason

I want to review my culinary activity today. Today is just an ordinary day, no special event or someone’s birthday. When I was just finished taking lectures, Mila chatted me and asked if I was free or not because Mila wanted an accompany\(?\) to secretariat room of faculty’s Student Executive Board. Fortunately, yes I was free but I was hungry. So before going to the secretariat room we went to buy foods. We found rice + fried chicken in front of Padjadjaran University and bought one pack each person then brought those to the secretariat room.

In the secretariat room I was jobless so after eating my food I decided to do some of my tasks while waiting Mila finishing her business in secretariat room with her co-workers from Environment Department. Night came and finally Mila finished. She brought me to D’cubes, a new restaurant in Jatinangor. The reason was simple: we were both hungry again. I had to admit the interior and facilities were very nice but not for the price of the foods. This restaurant is recommended for group of people but not for couple like me and Mila LOL.

As you can see in the photo, I ordered rice bowl and banana milkshake. It’s the first time for me eating fried eggplant\(?\) WTF is this? I thought it’s taro \(ubi ungu\). Err… Okay until now I’m still confused it’s eggplant or taro. That’s it for today’s food review. Don’t come here in the middle or last days of the month, I swear.
