# Last Chess Battle of Instagram

Uh yeah the last chess battle of Instagram is coming today. I wasn’t prepared at all. I didn’t care anymore about this okay I was so tired.

So before the battle came, Iyon and me changed the WoI. Yea although it’s already too late, you know this month will be ended in two days again. Actually I’m sad because the only people who care about this program seems only Iyon, Senior Cipto, and me. Even the head of the department sometimes didn’t help us just a little. Can we survive till the end of recess? 😭

This is the new look of our wall magazine. There are a lot of patches we made using origami paper because the contents that we removed leaving scars on the cartons. And again, in that random situation, Iyon gave me some good ideas. “Why don’t we use push pins instead gluing the contents to the cartons? We even can save money from buying new cartons every month right?” Ah, thanks a lot dude. I know even you didn’t show your interested face, you still wanted the best for our department right? I wish some talents like you deserves a better status in organization or committees 🙂

After finishing our job, I told him to support me for today’s battle. He might be not give me some words like “Don’t give up!” or “Keep your spirits up!” just “I know you can.” but his words really made me happy. I really thanked for today’s wall magazine change because I thought I only can talk face to face like this when we were doing our department jobs.

Then I waited in the game room. I didn’t wait for a long time like the first battle, not longer after that I was told to get ready. My opponent was Senior Hilda. At first round I won because I used white pieces. But in the second round I lost because I used black pieces. Huh I really sucked at using black pieces 😫

After the second round was finished, we took a break for a while. Damn, even though the room is cooled by air conditioner, my body sweated a lot. I really couldn’t believe myself, the one who always boasted about ever being a 2nd winner of chess championship, was afraid to face chess battle again. I swore I never do this again after this battle.

The break ended and we continued the battle. Although I used white pieces I still couldn’t win the battle. The end. Huah I was relieved at least I didn’t have to compete again in OSEAN chess battle. OSEAN is an event which looks like Instagram but the participants are from all of the departments in Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty in Padjadjaran University. So it means whoever wins in Instagram battles will be the representative for OSEAN battles. Let’s end all of this :\(\(\(
