# Cereal for Rich Kost Dudes

Sorry guys if youâ€™re poor donâ€™t read this food review! Haha Iâ€™m kidding. After having troubles with spaghetti I thought I would never try rich food again. But this one is different. Cereal isnâ€™t something difficult to make right? Besides that I have a lot of milk powder sachets in my room that I rarely drink. So maybe I can use it for my cereal.

The preparation is simple. You just need a bowl, hot water, and a sachet ofmilk powder. Make the milk first. After waiting for the hot milk cooler, you can add the cereal. I said this to prevent the cereal be mushy.
