# Pray for Satay

Today is a very special day for Transformation Cabinet because the Executive Board of Padjadjaran University came to share their vision and mission to us also learn about our programs. It was the first time of my grand launching video showed in front of a lot of people. LOL every time I see my edits I thought “Did I really do that?”. Forget it. Oh yes I forgot to show you the video, maybe next time if I remember.

The event was not so long. After introducing each other, we made a FGD or Focus Group Discussion. It’s about some hot issues in Padjadjaran University and we had to share our thoughts about those problems. I’m not a kind of a provocative person so I chose to be silent and just listened to them. In the middle of the FGD, I was asked by Internal Relation Department to discuss about Mathematics and Natural Sciences Family’s Dies Natalis. I had to make the coming soon poster as fast as I could. I also had to think about the Dies Natalis theme concept. When the event was over, I stopped discussing too and went home with Mila.

Actually we wanted to eat Rahayu’s fried rice but unfortunately it was closed. So we decided to buy satay where the store is beside Rahayu. In the middle when we waited for the satay got ready, Mila was called by the head of her department. Did I ever mention that Mila was also the part of Transformation Cabinet? Yeah, she is the part of Environment Department.

Back to the story, so because Mila was called to get back to the campus, I enjoyed the satay alone. For 15k, I got lots of skewers (tusuk sate?) + rice anf I thought it’s worth it. I recommended this.
