# Martabak Dilemma

Hey. I couldn’t type a lot today. My stomach hurts. Maybe my period will come again in no time. Thank God today is Monday so I can sleep a lot. I only have one class and usually the lecturer doesn’t come because he is so busy. That means Monday can be my holiday until this semester ends yeah. Best class ever in this semester. There won’t be any scary Monday as we know in school days.

Okay because I’m sick and can’t walk to anywhere so I decided to use delivery to order today’s lunch and dinner. I chose to order martabak. I got the contact from Hasna, I heard that this one is recommended. Let’s see.

I ordered it on 1 PM but guess what? The order came on the afternoon. Damn, I can’t help myself again with my stomach. I didn’t taste the martabak like heaven as Hasna told. Just like an ordinary martabak huh. I thought I could order some various flavor too such as red velvet or green tea and various toppings too such as oreo or nutella maybe? But I’m telling you again, this is just an ordinary martabak. By the way, this martabak cart is located in Sayang.
