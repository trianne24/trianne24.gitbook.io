# First WoI of the Year

Hello, it’s me again telling about my campus life. Today it’s the day when me and my Media and Information department of Himatif making the first WoI of the year. WoI is derived from Wall of Information which is a wall magazine that updates every month (honestly it’s every two weeks but I’m not sure if I could do it). Why this program is important to tell? Because I’m the supervisor of this program. Yeah wtf. It’s not me who wanted this, it’s because the head of the department Senior Algif who made me the supervisor. I wanted to refuse but it’s already too late. Damn, I took double duties on wall magazine… One in the faculty and other in Himatif -\_-

Before this day, I’ve already divided tasks for every Media and Information Department members. All tasks also had the deadline, from collecting the articles, making the designs so each month has its own theme, and last one is the deadline of creating the wall magazine.

So, today is the deadline of creating the wall magazine. After lectures finished I directly went to the checkpoint room with Iyon to do it. Yeah, only two of us. I was really disappointed to other staffs. Fine it’s okay, maybe they had their own business.
