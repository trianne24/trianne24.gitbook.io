# Infographic Design Competition for COIN

Heya again I’m coming back for today because I want to tell about Coin or Competition of Informatics which is one of the programs of Research and Development Department in Himatif. Before telling what competition I joined, I tell you first all the competitions in Coin.

This event had two competition categories, academic and product development. The academic category had three competitions: infographic design, competitive programming, and short movie. And the product development category had two competitions: web development and android app development. Those two categories won’t be held on the same day. I forgot for the product development category but the academic category is today.

Well, actually I wasn’t interested to join those competitions because my intention this year was being active in organizations and committees. But I was asked to join the infographic design competition with Iyon. Damn, just because I had designing skill didn’t mean I wanted to compete my designs to seniors. Yeah, academic competitions were only asked for two representatives each generation. I was relieved when Angga wanted to replace me, but he couldn’t be trusted! I was still forced to join this competition.

Okay, at first I thought there wouldn’t be any problem, but when I entered the competition room, I was shocked because every participants had already known the theme! Damn, Angga didn’t tell me too the theme huh. The theme of the infographic was about technology in this era. Because I just knew the theme, I was in hurry searching for the infographic contents. I thought for some hits apps, selfies, and hoaxes but finally I chose selfies. Yeay, as you can see my design below.

Soooo simple and minimalist right? And again, I used my favorite font of all: Bebas Neue. I always like simplicity and minimalist things, hope when I reuse Instagram again I could update my feeds with some minimalist ideas but for now I’m stuck to think something.
