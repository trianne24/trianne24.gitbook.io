# Upgrading My Life

Maybe you were wondering what is upgrading that I mean here? It is one of the programs by Cabinet Resources Bureau. Simply I told this is just a little seminar about work hard and team work also in the end we did FGD or Focus Group Discussion about life surviving case. Kind of boring I thought, I got no new lesson from this seminar. But it’s okay, it’s fun enough to be with my Transformation family.

After that, we took a picture of all Transformation members and then went home. Of course I went home with Mila since she is my temporary home neighbor. But she had to have meeting with other Environment Department members, so I decided to be an intruder inside them. They chose Sushiku as the meeting venue. Actually I was forbidden to listen their meeting contents but believe me, I won’t tell any soul about it haha.

For the food review, hmm not worth it. Not recommended. Too much wasting money for food that won’t make my stomach satisfied. Haha I’m sorry I couldn’t take the picture of the full sushi. By the way, since when I become a food tester like this???
