# Instagram 2017

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png>)

Today is the first day of Instagram, which stands for Informatics Sports, Arts, and Games Tournament. Itâ€™s one of Talent and Interest Department programs and have already held twice. Simply, itâ€™s an event of sports, arts, and games tournament for Himatif big family. As the committee I have to wake up early in the morning of the weekends :((( And it will be my routines every weekends till the closing event.

By the way, letâ€™s start from the very first time how I could be one of the committee in Instagram. Actually this is the very first committee I take in 2017 and the very risky committee in my life. I wasnâ€™t interest in any sports activities. I registered myself just because I gambled. I took medic division and I didnâ€™t fill the form seriously. When I was asked about my experience in medical business, I honestly said I barely know anything. But itâ€™s a miracle I was accepted. New committee, new duty.

After some general meetings, we held the technical meeting for all participants from Himatif big family on February 27th. The purpose of the technical meeting was telling about the rules of all the competitions in Instagram.

Okay thatâ€™s it for the Instagram openings. To be continued. Damn, my precious weekends ðŸ˜©
