# Forbidden Food Entered Jatinangor?!

Go blame me, I donâ€™t care. I never went to devotion (kebaktian?) until todayâ€™s coming. There were always business in Thursdays for me. So today I collected all my spirits to come to devotion in House of Joy Cikuda. Well, because I never went there I got a little problem to get there. Although in the end I was picked up by Satrio with his motorcycle. As I knew Satrio had ever been here but maybe he forgot in that moment. Okay, I didnâ€™t expect something wow in this devotion. We prayed, we sang, we listened to the sermon, and finally we collected tithe (persembahan) then sang again. Umm by the way the devotion theme of this week is this. (Do you notice the typo? Yeah I just noticed it today from the projector presentation. But itâ€™s not me who made it, Senior Daniel was :p)

In the end of the devotion, all of the people there took photos and wefies. The best part of today was my mentoring group were completed! I didnâ€™t count Melati included because she was already gone for a long time ðŸ˜•

This one is one of the photos I took with my mentoring group. There were Senior Friscil, Viona, and Dwinna. Oh, ignore me please. My period came on the wrong time so I wore training shorts and my department jacket to cover it.

Finally before I went home I met Senior Nydia who was also went to this devotion to take my bacap aka seasoned pork(?). Several days ago, I paid that food because I was craving for pork which was sold by Statistics Christians Community (I donâ€™t know their community name) so I ordered one for tonightâ€™s dinner. Actually the price was too expensive for a student like me but why not for the first time?

I couldnâ€™t wait again so when I arrived at home I directly sat and ate my dinner. OH MY GOD. This one. Forbidden but satisfying. I knew I shouldnâ€™t review this food but believe me, once you eat you canâ€™t stop. Thanks for today God!
