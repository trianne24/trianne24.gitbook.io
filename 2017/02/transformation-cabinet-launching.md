# Transformation Cabinet Launching

Today is the launching event of Transformation Cabinet, the cabinet of Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty’s Student Executive Board from Padjadjaran University this year. And now as usual I want to tell you the story.

Before today, I had to help Internal Relation Department doing some editing and presentation. I even got kidnapped by them from my temporary home to secretariat room of the faculty’s Student Executive Board. Yeah, so basically this event is one of their programs and of course they need professional design for it. In other place, I was doing my project to make organigram for the cabinet. It’s only for Media Department business, but when they saw my edits, Senior Ali as the head of Internal Relation Department messaged me to edit for them.

They needed me to edit all the people from the cabinet to be cropped and shadowed. It looked easy for me but still I got a simple but annoying problem: my temporary home’s WiFi wasn’t working and I couldn’t connect to it. Also the people from the cabinet were so many and I couldn’t edit fast. That’s why I was kidnapped so I could use WiFi and do edits faster.

Me, Senior Lukman, and other Internal Relation Department staffs were still working until night. By the way, Senior Lukman is the President of Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty’s Student Executive Board. I sort have a crush on him since he manly drove me home recently. Ah forget it, back to the topic. In the night, suddenly Senior Ali’s friends came and brought surprises to him because it was his birthday. Then we were invited to eat the tumpeng aka Senior Ali’s birthday cake. Whoa such a helper in hunger. After some refreshing time, we continued our works including my edits which were still unfinished until we got home. Yeah, I was tired and decided to continue it tomorrow aka today.

This morning, I finally finished the edits and woohoo guess what problems did I face now. There were two meetings today, coordination meeting of Himatif’s Media and Information Department and Instagram’s meeting, and of course the event today. Thank God I could attend those all.

The Instagram’s meeting talked about the tagline for the event. The coordination meeting of Himatif’s Media and Information Department talked about the wall magazine aka WoI which were going to be made this month. Last, our main event, the launching of Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty’s Student Executive Board and its societies.

Because I attended those meetings, I couldn’t watch the event from the beginning till the end, just the main event where all departments were introduced. Finally, when the event was finished I directly went back to my temporary home with Fahmi. Yeah, I didn’t take a lot of photos like others because I didn’t want to go home alone and in that time there was only Fahmi. But there was a photo which I thought was my best shot. Tadaa…

Yes, you’re right I was wearing my Hector hoodie for this event because the dresscode of this event should be tosca (blue-green) colored and the only one tosca piece I had was my Hector hoodie. Hoho.

Thanks to Internal Relation Department for today! Being the part of faculty’s Student Executive Board is exhausting but satisfied guarantee. I hope for the best in this year of Transformation!
