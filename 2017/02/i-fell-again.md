# I Fell Again

I don’t know what mood can describe my situation today. So today my usual food store to order food was closed. I also didn’t have much balance (pulsa?) to message delivery order to other food store. Then I decided to just eat Indomie Cup.

Today wasn’t the first time I made Indomie Cup. I forgot when but it’s before I got [throat hurt](throat-hurt.md). I just told you today because I didn’t take the photo LOL. So here it is.

Can you see those broken Indomie? Yeah so basically it’s just Pop Mie Cup but I recycled it to make Indomie there. And… Ignore the flavor of the Indomie. it’s just because there was only fried noodle flavor.

After that, I went to campus for making wall magazine for faculty’s Student Executive Board. Unfortunately, when I just wanted to go, the rain was falling hard. I waited until the rain stopped. I felt inpatient so bad while reaching campus because the public cars I took were waiting for many passengers before going. Then I walked to the meeting point in our dean (dekanat). I’d just reached it when I stupidly fell on stairway. My butt hurt. In the beginning I was okay but suddenly I couldn’t see anything and almost fainted in front of the head of Media Department, Senior Tiar. I also threw up Indomie ugh.

After resting for a while I finally could walk and help making wall magazine. But again, my butt still hurt, exactly in the sacrum and tail bone (coccyx). Senior Tiar even suggested me to meet masseur so I could heal without any health problem. Yeah I also worried if I couldn’t have a baby :((( DEAR GOD PLEASE DON’T :(((

Finally our first wall magazine was almost finished. Yeah, because there were some pending contents that we haven’t printed. So far, here is our first wall magazine.

We will continue tomorrow. Then we got home but I went to Ramen Bajuri with Mila. Oh yes, I haven’t told you about this ramen store, right? Umm yeah I recommend this place so bad. The ramen is very worth it and not so expensive. And don’t forget to order Bohay tea for drink because it’s big but cheap.

Alright it’s for today. Btw I chose the title “I Fell Again” because it’s not the first time I fell lately. The first time was when “[Unity in Transformation Cabinet](unity-in-transformation-cabinet.md)” event. I fell and hurt my knee and still bluish until now. Now, a week after that falling, I hurt my sitting bones so I couldn’t sit well. Between those falling, I also hurt my throat but luckily it’s already gone. Hurts in a row from top to toe 😭
