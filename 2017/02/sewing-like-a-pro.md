# Sewing Like a Pro

I have a raincoat. A comfort one, because itâ€™s big and easy to use. But poorly, itâ€™s a little bit ripped off. And now I would like to present my skill fixing this raincoat LOL. Please donâ€™t try this at home okay.

Before that, Iâ€™d already thought to watch videos from YouTube about how to sew ripped cloth but I found no videos which told the tutorial properly. So I hopelessly decided to sew randomly like I could.

Those photos above were the results! Hahaha please blame me, I wasnâ€™t an ideal wife if I couldnâ€™t sew properly. Iâ€™ll try again in another time. I want to give stuffy gift to my ideal boyfriend OMG ðŸ˜­
