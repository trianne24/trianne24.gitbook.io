# First Face to Face Meeting of Literature Division

Today Himatif had two programs to run, they are secretarial and financial seminar. Those programs were closed only for Himatif caretakers not for Himatif big family or even public. The first seminar was secretarial seminar and about how to make letters, proposals, and accountability reports (laporan pertanggung jawaban). The last one was financial seminar which taught us how to make financial reports and how to redeem our cash from organization funds. Not really interesting huh, but I enjoyed them till the end.

After that I went to Senior Yoan’s temporary home. What’s for? As the title of this post, yeah for the first Literature Division of Misiologi Christian Students Community meeting! And this is the first face to face meeting of us. By the way, let me tell first the staffs in this division. They are Senior Daniel as the head of division, Senior Eva, Senior Yoan, Satrio, and me. But in this first meeting, we weren’t full-team because Senior Eva didn’t come. Actually I even don’t know any info about her because she never showed up in group chat and now she didn’t come. LOL whatever. I know someday she will show up.

Please just ignore the photo that Senior Daniel took LOL. In this first meeting, Senior Silvia as the president of Misiologi CSC also joined this meeting. We talked about the rules of being Misiologi CSC caretakers, timeline for our programs, and the publication posters. I don’t know why, but since I’m in love with BEM KEMA FMIPA UNPAD because its beautiful publication posters, I can’t stop thinking about making some new changes for organizations that I join like Himatif and Misiologi CSC. Unfortunately, I didn’t get supports of making publication poster templates for Himatif. Yeah whatever I don’t care because I will make them next year.

Back to business, so we decided to make publication poster templates for Misiologi CSC publications. Guess what, I was asked to do all! OMG believe me I’m just such a newbie. I learned to design by myself. But everyone was so enthusiastic and I was supported by them to do it. Fine, I’ll do my best. In this meeting we were only decided the color palettes we use. Although we also decided for fonts but I wasn’t sure if I could fit them with the color palettes so for the fonts choosing was given to me.

I thought that’s all for the meeting. After that meeting, Senior Yoan and me talked another business outside Misiologi, it’s about BEM Kema FMIPA. Yeah, she was also the part of it and she was the staff of Strategic Studies Department (Departemen Kajian Strategis). Then we got home each other.
