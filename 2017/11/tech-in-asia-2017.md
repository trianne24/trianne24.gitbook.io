# Tech in Asia 2017

Itâ€™s the first time for me going to Jakarta in the middle of semester! I even didnâ€™t tell my family I went to Jakarta because I didnâ€™t want they became worried. I went to Jakarta only because I wanted to go to Tech in Asia event, the biggest technology event in Asia. I went there with some seniors from my department because in my generation there were only Malik and Ibnu who were going. Malik was going with some other seniors from my department and Ibnu was going alone by himself because he was already in Jakarta since yesterday.

This event was held on November 1st and 2nd 2017 but we only went on the first day. On November 1st in the morning I went to Jakarta by using rent car. The trip was very long and even made me sleepy. There were also some funny stories inside the car but I didnâ€™t want to tell here because it was privacy(?). When we arrived in the venue, we all were separated but I was following Senior Ojan. We were looking every stands inside without any left and hunting some goodies and business cards from the stands. The goodies we got werenâ€™t as priceless as we thought. There were Google company which gave us tumblr bottle, Bitcoin company which gave us glass and t-shirt, and many more stands with lots of surprise. At Sumo365 stand, there was a lucky chance to win one of the goodies they served. He got another tumblr bottle and I just got a pin. At Furnizing stand, there was also a lucky chance to win a Minion doll powerbank but we didnâ€™t get it. Not only goodies, we also hunted for free foods especially the 5 dollars yogurt. We only had to follow an Instagram account then we got it for free!

After wasting a long time in the venue, we were united again with the others from the rent car team and going back to home. Before that, we took a photo together. Please ignore my face ðŸ˜…

Finally we left Jakarta but our trip wasnâ€™t over. We went to a satay restaurant and also searched for roasted corn. At that time I was a little worried because tomorrow I had to take a midterm test but since I was with Senior Ojan I believed there wouldnâ€™t be any regret to go along with them. We arrived in Jatinangor on the next day just before the sun went up. I just slept for a while then prepared for the midterm test today.
