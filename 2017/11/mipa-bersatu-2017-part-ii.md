# MIPA Bersatu 2017 Part II

MIPA Bersatu Part II was the closing event for MIPA Bersatu which was already held first on August 24th. Check [here](../08/mipa-bersatu-2017.md) for Part I.

I had to admit for this closing event I almost did nothing as a staff in publication and documentation division. I wasn’t as active as when I prepared for the Part I. I almost didn’t check the official account again to answer some funny questions again. When I checked it I saw that Senior Rana already answered them mostly so I didn’t know what help could I do to this event again.

On this day I also felt I was jobless. I came there and I just had to follow Fikri as the daily division manager of MIPA Bersatu Part II to borrow my phone to him. At that time his phone was broken but he really needed a phone to contact other daily division managers. That’s why I didn’t get any job on this day.

Today the freshmen of Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty should went to all posts to have games. All staffs of publication and documentation division were already separated into groups so we only took photos and videos in the post we got. Because I had to borrow my phone to Fikri, I was in a group with him and stayed in a post with Cap Buricap game. It was a game that tested solidarity. The players in a group should moved in the same way as the other players’ last moves. The group with the consistent moves would win. LOL I was confused and couldn’t describe how to play this game so I was sorry if you didn’t understand.

After all groups of freshmen were already finished all games in posts, they were gathered again in sports arena of Jati to make a mozaic. I didn’t know what’s the name just called it mozaic. They had to make a rectangle shape and brought up the paper so when the paper was gathered on air it looked like a big picture.

Again, at that time I was bored because I did nothing but just waited them finished the mozaic. Finally after the mozaic time finished, the freshmen gathered to listen for the awards announcement. There were awards for the best group, the best vlog, and many more. Then they went back home each other. As the committees we couldn’t go back home early but we had to evaluate our jobs first. After evaluation, we were eating fried ball tofu (tahu bulat) and taking photos together. That’s how this committee ended.

Ah yes I forgot, this photo above was my last bonding time with all staffs in publication and documentation division without Senior Umar and Senior Abid (they couldn’t come because they were busy with their final hearing). We were having pizzas at Domino’s several days after MIPA Bersatu 2017 Part II was ended. Thanks to Senior Ega as the project officer of MIPA Bersatu 2017, Senior Abid as the head of sector who lead this division, Senior Rana as the head of this division, Fikri, Amalia, Okat, Pange, Senior Iman, and Senior Umar for the togetherness!!!
