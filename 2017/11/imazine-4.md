# IMAZINE #4

Imazine was the first committee which I became the leader or in this case we called ‘Editor in Chief’. It was a digital magazine of Himatif which was published every year. This year was the 4th Imazine and the theme was “Colors of Himatif”. Please kindly help me by downloading the magazine [here](http://bit.ly/IMAZINE2017) or check out the e-magazine below.

Actually I was happy because I was trusted to be the Editor in Chief this year. The process of making the magazine was also fun. But because I was very busy with another committees and organizations, the progress was paused in the middle so in the last week of deadline I was so confused and disorganized. Senior Algif even recruited new members for the editorial team. They were from our apprentices. So the total of the final editorial team members were increased from 11 to 16. Finally, after sacrifice some things, I finished the magazine on time just a day before recess. Actually I planned to publish it on November 22nd but because we finished it overnight so we published it on the next day. The next day I meant was today.

At 1 PM today we finally published Imazine 4 along with Impression 2 which you could watch above. Impression 2 was also my department’s program which was a video about all Himatif programs during a year. And if you asked about the first Impression, it was already published in [Impression Cabinet Launching](../02/grand-launching-of-himatif-2017.md). Yeah I thought all of my depressions were over but no I was wrong. There was an error in the magazine so we had to fix it and reupload the magazine. I finished it on night because today the Executive Board had to have evaluation meeting with the Legislative Board.

Thank God I could finish my first responsibility to be a leader for the first time. I also want to thank all of the editorial team members including media and information departments staffs with pizzas later.
