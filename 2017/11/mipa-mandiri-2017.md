# MIPA Mandiri 2017

MIPA Mandiri was a talkshow about scholarship, entrepreneurship, and part-time working. The speakers were so many and I didn’t really remember their names. I was overslept and didn’t arrive on time to the venue of this event. Luckily I only had to stand by on the attendance desk as the secretary of the committee. It was a little boring because I was alone and couldn’t see the talkshow. When I got my rest time, I went to the venue and disguised as one of participants so I could see the talkshow. After the talkshow, there was entrepreneurship expo which were filled by Padjadjaran University’s students. I bought a lot of foods and things in there.

Before joining this committee, I was very pessimistic because Fajar became the vice project officer. I was afraid his bad attitudes would be coming up again just like in Great Deliberation III of Himatif. I also was disappointed that I was chosen to be Secretary not the head of publication and documentation division. Instead Fajar and Senior Indah (the project officer) chose Ihza. Times rolled and Ihza suddenly resigned from his job. Then he was replaced by Rizha, one of publication and documentation staffs. At first Rizha looked so diligent but she really hated to sell foods for making money. Damn! She didn’t know I almost didn’t eat anything for a week because I had to cover the sales income. I felt sorry for Kevin who was the head of funds division. He had to argue with Rizha because of her selfishness. At last Rizha won the argue. She still didn’t want to pay her sales target WTF.

The money we got from the sales and sponsors was more than enough. We had lots of foods and goodies leftover which could be shared for all of the committees. I was so happy today because being part of this committee wasn’t as bad as I thought before.
