# Misiologi Mengucap Syukur 2017

This morning I had to wake up early for another committee to complete. Today will be the day of Misiologi Mengucap Syukur 2017. This event was for welcoming all Christians freshmen from Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty, Pharmacy Faculty, and Geological Engineering Faculty. It was the first time for me wearing skirt, not because I wanted but it was the dresscode for the committees.

I had a problem with Easy Worship presentation in the event. Well, this was what you got if you used illegal software. The software wouldn’t work in my laptop, so I asked everyone for another laptop to play the Easy Worship presentation. I was almost gave up and decided to make a manual presentation with Powerpoint instead. Suddenly, with some help from the speaker of the event whose I forgot his name, the presentation could be played on the screen.

At the same day, there would be comparative study from Diponegoro University to Himatif Executive Board. So in the middle of MMS 2017, I went to that event. In the event, people from Himatif was amazed with me because I never wore skirt before. Hey please, it’s just because I had to wear dresscode! Skirt wasn’t my fashion and wearing it was making me hard to join on a motorcycle.

I thought this comparative study would be interesting but unfortunately it was so-so. After this event finished I came back to MMS 2017 again. The main event was already finished and there were performances left. Luckily I wasn’t late for watching my juniors from Informatics Engineering singing on the stage. Wow I didn’t believe they were so good in singing. After that we were taking photos and went back home each other.
