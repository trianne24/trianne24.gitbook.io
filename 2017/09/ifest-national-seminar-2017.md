I remembered last year I went to IFest National Seminar and today I went there again. Of course this year’s vibe was different than last year’s. It’s not just because the venue was in Bandung, but also the story behind this event.

A night before today, I went to Maria’s temporary home not just to play with her but also make me easy to go to the venue. Seriously I’d ever thought I wouldn’t go to the seminar because the venue was difficult to reach so that’s why I prepared myself from the night before. Unfortunately she wasn’t in her free time to play so after having a little talk with her, I slept early and she did her homework. In the morning, I used Uber service to reach the venue of the seminar. And wow, I couldn’t believe my eyes, the price was only two thousand rupiahs. It looked like I was using public car not a motorcycle.

When I was arrived in the venue, luckily I found Bening so I didn’t have to be alone while lots of my friends were working as committees. I sat beside her and followed the seminar from the beginning until finish. This year’s theme was “Empowering Entrepreneurs Everywhere in the Era of IoT” and there were four awesome speakers as you can see on the poster. Actually I was a little bored in the beginning because the speakers were not attractive to the audience. I even helped Bening to find mistakes in this event for an evaluation so I wouldn’t be bored (At that time, Bening was one of the Legislative Board of Himatif who worked to evaluate Executive Board’s programs). Finally the final speaker was come and unfortunately he wasn’t Mr. Oscar Darmawan, the CEO of Bitcoin Indonesia, but just a person from Bitcoin Indonesia (I forgot what his position and his name). But I found he was very attractive and the material was fun so I found myself listening to him carefully.

After the seminar was finished, there was also an announcement for the winner of the Web Development and Paper competitions. Then I took a photo with the project officer of IFest 2017 and went to Yagami by Uber service again. Yeah I went to have a dinner with Maria in Yagami. At that time we talked a lot, more than yesterday night because today she had already finished her homework so she was very free. After eating and talking a lot, we walked to Maria’s temporary home and I went back to Jatinangor.
