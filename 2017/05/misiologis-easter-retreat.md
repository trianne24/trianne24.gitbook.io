# Misiologi’s Easter Retreat

I was so thankful I joined this retreat instead of joining comparative study to Bina Nusantara University with Impressive Cabinet or comparative study from Indonesia Islamic University with Transformation Cabinet. Finally I could choose God first from all of my organizations’ activities.

This retreat trip was for celebrating this year’s Easter party with Misiologi people and it was held for two days, yesterday and today. At first, I joined this because I was asked directly by Senior Silvia, the president of Misiologi itself and she had already asked since a long time ago so I couldn’t reject her. About two days before the event started, I was invited into retreat participants group chat. I saw there were some friends I knew who also joined like Firman, Mora, and Viona. That’s why I surely wanted to join this retreat because I knew I wouldn’t be alone like last retreat I had ever joined from my church in Jakarta.

And the day was coming. I went to the meeting point by public transportation and luckily met Firman inside. I talked a lot with him until we reached the meeting point. Then after waiting some participants arrived at the meeting point, we finally departed together with some public transportation which were already rented for retreat purpose. I slept a lot in the public transportation even until we arrived at the villa. I had to admit that the villa was hard to reach.

Okay, let’s talk about what we did during retreat. We sang, we listened to the sermon, and the best part of yesterday was watching movie! The movie title was “The Encounter”, I highly recommended this movie even though at first I didn’t understand the movie. After that we slept in bedrooms which were shared with other participants.

Oh yes, I had another best moment last night. I couldn’t believe that Senior Ruth was Mister Marbun’s daughter! Just info Mister Marbun was the former principal of 81 Senior High School where I studied. He was fired just because some people didn’t like Christian man like him being principal. Whoa, I heard a very different issue that he was involved in corruption. At that night, Mora and I listened a lot about Senior Ruth’s father alias our beloved former principal. Life in 81 Senior High School was better in his hand rather than after he was fired. By the way, Mora was actually my senior who also studied in 81 Senior High School but he was just accepted in Physics Major on the same year like me. Another info, Mister Marbun was fired last year which meant the year when I graduated. I was really disappointed with my senior high school because of the new principal but I didn’t want to tell a lot why here.

The next day alias today, we had an egg searching game. I didn’t get any egg haha. We also had an outdoor game for teams. I was in yellow team and again I didn’t win at all LOL. After that we took a lot of photos in some nice places near the villa. The photo above was my favorite photo in the forest near the villa.

Finally we prepared to go back home. But unfortunately it was raining so we were all wet before getting inside the public transportation that we used before. Yeah, that’s it for the retreat activities! Thank God we all safely arrived in Jatinangor and went back to each others’ home.
