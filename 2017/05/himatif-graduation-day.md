# Himatif Graduation Day

Every year, Padjadjaran University celebrates a graduation ceremony three times. And today is the second time for this year. The first one was in February if I‚Äôm not wrong.

Himatif has a program for congratulating graduated seniors from Internal Relation Department, the name is Himatif Graduation Day. All of Himatif big family can attend the graduation ceremony in Himatif stand where we show our congratulations with balloons, flowers, and singing Hymn of Himatif. Actually as one of Cabinet‚Äôs people I should go there too but I wasn‚Äôt interested.

The graduation ceremony was at 4 PM so all classes from 1 PM were cancelled. I thought to go home but Last Cake called to gather at 2 PM. By the way Last Cake is a project team consisted Senior Asep, Senior Ical, and Shofi which I will explain more next time. While waiting for Last Cake, I was slept in the library. Unconsciously, it‚Äôs already 2 PM! Suddenly Senior Asep and Senior Ical cancelled our meeting. And then when I wanted to go home, I saw a lot of yellow-jacketed people gathered to go together to the graduation ceremony. I was forced by Shofi to join them even though I didn‚Äôt bring my yellow jacket ![üôÅ](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/svg/1f641.svg) So, that‚Äôs how I ended up attending today‚Äôs graduation ceremony.

There were some of us who ride motorcycle and others who used bus. I was in the bus team with Shofi, Hilya, Bening, Fira, Hasna, Iyon, Malik, Kevin, Raihan, and Ihza. (Sorry if I forgot someone to mention :p) At first I didn‚Äôt enjoy the ride because we didn‚Äôt get any more seats in the bus so we had to stand up along the ride. But in the middle of our ride, I felt so crazy with them. We were too loud when we were joking and embarrassing people but we didn‚Äôt care as long as nobody was angry right?

Luckily we arrived on time. The graduation ceremony had just started. As I had already mentioned above, we sang Hymn of Himatif and gave the graduated seniors with balloons and flowers. After that we took a lot of photos then prepared to go home. I had already expected that it would be harder go back to Jatinangor because the bus we used before didn‚Äôt available for nights. So we decided to use travel service. I meant me and my friends Fira, Ihza, Iyon, Raihan, Yosua, and Kevin. Those who got here with bus and didn‚Äôt mention had already gotten their way to go home. The travel service had its own departure time so while waiting for it, we searched for dinner around there. We ordered pecel lele, but I hated when I knew the price was very expensive for a portion of pecel lele. Aaaah that‚Äôs how Bandung people lived, I was lucky I lived in Jatinangor.

Although we had already finished eating our dinner, we still had to wait about an hour again for the travel service so Ihza requested to get back to Jatinangor using public transportation. We didn‚Äôt reject it as we also were already bored to wait. We had to use three public transportation to get Jatinangor. Each public transportation we used, we had to pay four thousands rupiahs. I took a pity to us especially Ihza, who had to pay a lot even though it‚Äôs a public transportation.

Finally when we reached Jatinangor, I followed Kevin to his temporary home and so I didn‚Äôt have to walk alone to Sayang because I had Kevin who took me to my temporary home. Ugh thanks a lot for making my purse empty, dear graduation ceremony :‚Äù( By the way because today, I just remembered someone who is my half piece of heart so I wished ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà all the best for his last project (skripsi)! Hope he can get graduated too soon üòç
