# Technopreneur 2017

![](http://blogs.unpad.ac.id/realicejoanne/files/2017/05/PosterFULL_FIX_000000.png)

Ah again, just the same like Instagram committee, I registered myself on the last day of the open recruitment. But for this committee, I chose to be serious by taking publication and documentation division because I saw potential with the division, completed with Iyon and Senior Algif. The other best part was Rey and Abie which were also in the same division with me. Such a division goal right?

At the first time honestly I didn’t enjoy the division because there was only me as a female and the others were males. The group chat was so silent and even I left and joined twice because I wanted to break the silence. LOL I was so overacting. Luckily, after Senior Ceri joined in the group chat, this division started to give good progress. Yeah I thought it’s enough telling about my own division LOL. I didn’t want to tell our problems while making publications. It’s okay I knew everyone could make mistakes. And finally the day was coming today.

Err… No. I still wanted to tell some flashbacks. Did you remember about the “door to door” strategy I told [here](../04/such-an-exhausting-day.md)? It was also the part of Technopreneur committee’s misery. I’m kidding. There was the worse strategy more than “door to door”. Reselling Snickers bars. Ha. Thanks a lot I could spend a lot for and taste chocolates in Jatinangor.

I also wanted to tell this flashback. One day, there was a meeting for primary committees. Rey, as the head of publication and documentation division, asked me to replace him in the meeting because he was in Jakarta at that time. At first I refused him but finally I still went there. I mostly didn’t pay attention to the meeting because I was busy with my phone. I even talked to Senior Ojan a lot because at that moment Senior Algif was performing solo vocal for OSEAN so we both teased him to give supports\(?\)

Well that’s all for the flashbacks. Now it’s when the day was coming. For your information the venue of Technopreneur event was in Dipati Ukur, City of Bandung. This year Technopreneur presented four awesome speakers. There were Edward Widjonarko \(Co-Founder of CICIL\), Adhitya Dwitama \(Application Development Manager of OLX Indonesia\), Oscar Darmawan \(CEO of Bitcoin Indonesia\), and Rachmad Imron \(CEO of Digital Happiness, the creator of DreadOut\). To reach the venue, I joined in Abie’s car with Afifah, Vega, Rey, and Iyon. I hate to remember that we were all late because we were waiting for Rey taking a bath. Luckily the punishment didn’t really hard.

For today my job was editing and printing certificates for participants so I fully worked in the committee’s room which was located in the backstage. I took a pity to myself because I couldn’t listen any words from the speakers. My job also wasn’t that easy. Maybe the editing yes, but the printing was a big NO. I tried the printer too much so the certificates were printed in the exact middle center position on the paper. Then, when finally I found the best position for it, the printer ink ran out. Huh WTF did I do here? In the end, the certificates were printed by logistics division in the public fotocopy and printing place. After waiting logistics division to bring the certificates, I sorted them from A to Z so when the event was finished, the participants could take their certificates easily.

My job was finished coincide with the end of the event. Then I took a lot of photos with committees on the photobooth stand. I also helped other committees to clean the venue before we left it. Finally it’s all over. All committees were gathered. We were giving appreciations to everyone and of course the evaluations. I thought this event was a big success even all the problems were just a little distraction for us. All of the evaluations today were for the better next year’s. Oh wow, I couldn’t believe myself being one of the committees of this awesome public event. I even didn’t being mad with all the problems I had. I really thanked a lot because my choice to be one of this committees wasn’t wrong. Now I felt braver to try other public events like this.

Enough for today. Finally we went back home each other. But there was something different between how I got there and how I got back. At that moment Dzakia asked me if I wanted to exchange with her so it meant she got back using Abie’s car and I got back using Senior Ojan’s motorcycle which was Dzakia’s way to got there. I didn’t refuse her offer because I thought it would be fun to ride motorcycle on night. And I was super duper right! Along the way we got back to Jatinangor, I talked a lot with Senior Ojan so I didn’t get bored. Because of this I could know more about him even the info that he would be my neighbor in the next semester! I meant, our temporary home would be close. Woohoo, I’ve never been so happy like this.
