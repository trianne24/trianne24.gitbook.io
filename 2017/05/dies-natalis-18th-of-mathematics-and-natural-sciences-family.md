Happy birthday Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty big family! Tonight was the celebration of the birthday even though the actual birth date was on May 29th. The celebration or we said it “Dies Natalis” was also a closing ceremony of three big events in Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty. There were OSEAN by Talent and Interest Department, MIPA Science Cup by Academic Department, and Kuantum by Strategic Studies Department. The “Dies Natalis” event itself was held by Internal Relation Department. Hahaha, can you feel my worries? I always experienced something crazy with them. Remember when Internal Relation Department kidnapped me to prepare the [Launching event](../02/transformation-cabinet-launching.md)? And yes, it’s coming again for Dies, I thought I had ever mentioned it in [this post](../03/pray-for-satay.md).

For this event I only helped to make a photobooth backdrop but before that I had to quarrel with Afifah because she made me confused with the requests. I thought she wanted me to make banner but suddenly it changed to photobooth backdrop. Luckily I could handle it fast so the backdrop could be printed on time even though it was just designed a night before the event.

And then tonight was already over. At first I didn’t interest to come to the Dies event because I didn’t have someone or something to see. I even went to Griya Market with Mila but yeah finally we thought to pay a visit for a while to Dies. We were arrived on 10 PM so of course we were the last guests in this event LOL. In the event I saw there were OSEAN, MIPA Science Cup, and Kuantum winners announcements. In the end of the event, all presidents of Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty organizations were singing the Hymn of Scholar (I wasn’t sure with the exact name). I also took some photos with Himatif in front of the photobooth backdrop that I made last night. Unfortunately, I didn’t get the photos so I couldn’t show it here. After that, Mila and I went back home.
