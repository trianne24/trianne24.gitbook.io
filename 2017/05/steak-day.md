# Steak Day

Just because I had just taken money from my account so I wanted to enjoy for a while with my new fresh money. Although today there wasn’t nothing to tell, but as the title of this post I went for eating steak for real!

Actually I hated when I could go home faster and didn’t have anything to do in campus. Because I couldn’t find any idea for my dinner tonight! My friend Mila had some business in campus so I had to wait for her. When she arrived at temporary home, she had an idea to go to Waroeng Steak Jatinangor. Whoa, I couldn’t imagine I would have steak for my dinner.

I ordered this food which I forgot its name. As you can see, it’s beef steak with potato wedges and spaghetti on it. For the drink I only ordered plain tea. Of course because it’s steak, it’s soooooo delicious. But again, I didn’t recommend it because its price was too high LOL if I didn’t take money today I couldn’t eat a thing again for the next days. Besides that, I wasn’t satisfied with this dinner. My stomach still wanted more foods. Luckily there was tek-tek seller (I don’t know what to call) which was passing my temporary home. So Mila and I ordered for fried noodles to complete our dinner.

Tonight, as I said above, I didn’t have anything to do so I watched one of my movie collections in my laptop: May Who. A movie from Thailand which told about a girl who had an electricity power. Just watch, you will love it!
