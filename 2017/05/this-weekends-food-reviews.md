# This Weekend‚Äôs Food Reviews

This weekend maybe the best weekend for my stomach because I tried three new places to eat. Let‚Äôs start from the first one üòÄ

Yesterday I ate rice with chicken cordon bleu from Mega Canteen which was located in Sayang. I asked to deliver it to my place not ate in the place. The first time I knew this place was because my father took me to that place when he came to my temporary home several days ago. At that time I saw the menu and remembered that I had the photo of it. Wow, I never thought this place had been so famous since I always went to campus with this way and always saw this place was closed. That‚Äôs why I tried to deliver something hard to make to test if this place was recommended or not. And yes! I really would like to recommend this place so bad! Even my friend Mila was also being crazy ordering from this place.

Next one is Bakso Boedjangan which was located far away from my temporary home. I went there because Mila wanted to eat meatballs. So that night we went to the place and I ordered cheesy meatballs which I forgot its name. The meatballs were so delicious but I didn‚Äôt like the portion so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you‚Äôre very hungry. By the way I‚Äôm sorry I forgot to take a picture of it.

The next day, which meant today, Mila and I went to Mayasi, a ramen restaurant. I ordered cheesy ramen with beef and seaweed toppings. LOL I didn‚Äôt say this was bad but the appearance of the food made me laugh. I joked a lot with Mila about our orders and of course the price of them. Then we compared it to Bajuri, I didn‚Äôt remember if I ever talked about that in this blog but it was also a ramen restaurant with a big portion of ramen and of course the price was the best one. At least in Mayasi we could be full even though it wasn‚Äôt as big as the Bajuri‚Äôs portion.

That‚Äôs all for this weekend. Bonus! I wanted to tell too about some foods which I forgot to tell in the past.

Ta da! This one was called egg roll, but in Indonesia it was rolled by using satay‚Äôs skewers as you can see on the picture. I found this egg roll wagon when I just came back from the campus. I never saw it in my neighborhood so I decided to try it before I couldn‚Äôt see it again. And wow, these egg rolls were really big, not as like as the one I usually saw before. But I was really disappointed because I ordered the egg rolls with seasoning which made it salty üôÅ

Then I would like to recommend Ciseke Food Court or CFC as my friends usually called. Don‚Äôt forget to try jumbo milo shake there! And also Spongebob themed drinks as the one I ordered which name was Blue Mermaid. Don‚Äôt ask for the price, this one was really worth it so don‚Äôt worry about it.
