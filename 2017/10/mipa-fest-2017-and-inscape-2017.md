# MIPA FEST 2017 and Inscape 2017

Another committee was finished today. MIPA FEST 2017. The committee where I almost did nothing LOL. This event was held in two days, yesterday and today. Yesterday there was a national seminar and I only came in the beginning to handle absenteeism then I asked for permission to go to Senior Indra’s graduation ceremony in Bandung Institute of Technology. I was surely desperate to escape from my responsibility for meeting him. I heard that the national seminar wasn’t going well because the participants were only a few.

Today was the green day and also the closing of MIPA FEST too. In green day, all of the committee and some Jatinangor people walked relax together around Padjadjaran University. Actually it should be bicycling but because we didn’t have much money to prepare bicycles so it couldn’t be happened. After that we were gathered in Arboretum to held the closing event. There were doorprizes, performances, and science expo here. I never thought that the doorprizes would be this awesome. You know, there were rice cooker, clock, dispenser, and even TV! The best of it was Himatif people got almost all of the doorprizes even though we didn’t get the biggest one.

After the closing event finished, all of the committees were gathered for evaluation. At that time I got two ice cream which I ate one and another for Senior Ojan who was preparing for Inscape tonight. I wished he could work better after eating ice cream from me\(?\)

Then I went to my temporary home to do some of my jobs and prepared myself for Inscape. I went to the venue before the dark came. The decoration of the venue surely made me impressed. I liked the ticket box, the photobooth, and the stage. But I had to admit that the stands weren’t not really good. Some of technology stands were not attractive and some of food stands were dirty. I preferred enjoying the music stage instead of looking for the stands.

Ah yes, Inscape invited Amigdala, Senar Senja, Fourtwnty and also many awesome guest stars. I heard that the sold tickets were more than last year’s. I could see it here where everyone was very enthusiastic with the three top guest stars. They were singing along the artists while I enjoyed the music. I didn’t really like the crowd because some of them were smoking WTF but I loved how crowded this venue till the concert ended. Finally I went back to my temporary home and slept in peace.
