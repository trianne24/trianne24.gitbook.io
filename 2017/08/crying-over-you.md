# Crying Over You

Today should be my jobless day but I chose to go to MIPA Bersatu Socialization to represent the head of publication and documentation division, Senior Rana.

Ah by the way, I joined this committee just because I just want to run away from medic division. Some of medic people in departments student orientations (mabim jurusan) should be delegated to medic division in MIPA Bersatu. Luckily I was invited by Senior Rana to join publication and documentation division because she knew me from Student Executive Board in Transformation Cabinet.

During holidays, I was happy to join this committee because I didnâ€™t have a lot of jobs. Just posting posters and being a good senior to new students by answering their questions in social medias. LOL I didnâ€™t remember myself as a complicated new student. Just câ€™est la vie, aka life goes on. Some of new students I helped were so complicated by asking a lot of simple questions that even I already knew the answers before they asked -\_- Please, read before ask, dudes.

Last Saturday, MIPA Bersatu held a socialization which I came over to there. But unfortunately, it wasnâ€™t finished. And today was the socialization part 2. HA! Thatâ€™s a lot of just-for-your-information stories before we started to tell my stories today.

Today I woke up in the morning lazily. I took a bath without any rituals as usual because I thought I was gonna be late. But then, I went to the venue and waited for a looooong time because the audiences of this socialization hasnâ€™t came yet. I even finished a webcomic titled Hwa Ja by Hong Jac-Ga.

Finally it started. Everything went smoothly, it wasnâ€™t making a lot of emotions. At 12 AM, the socialization was paused. I ate grilled chicken with other committees. After that, it continued again until 3 PM.

Mila was also came to watch this socialization even she was late. Then I went to Ramen Bajuri with her. Before that I had to wait for a looooongg time because she talked a lot with Senior Mella and ignored me ðŸ˜­

In Ramen Bajuri, I talked with her a lot since she was just coming back yesterday from her hometown. Then we went to bookshop in Gerbang Lama, Padjadjaran University. She bought three books there. Actually I thought the books seller was a nice person, just before he hurt my heart by his lame jokes. Fortunately I could control myself and just forget what he said.

Ah finally reaching my room. I slept. I was tired. In the night I woke up again and tried to continue my Last Cake web project but suddenly when I saw this, I came to cry a river and shouted crazily. CONGRATULATIONS MY DEAR BIG BRO!! Or should I say the one that got away? OMG canâ€™t wait to go meet him later in graduation suit. Damn, what an emotional day.
