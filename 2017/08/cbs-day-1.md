# CBS Day 1

As I said yesterday, today is the second day of MIPA Bersatu Part I. I chose to arrive late because I didn’t want to be alone again like yesterday LOL. I just could say that in the second day actually my division didn’t really have a lot of jobs beside taking documentations. After that, the freshmen were brought by every departments to the next event. Similar to MIPA Bersatu, the next event was held for introducing freshmen in Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty in Padjadjaran University to their respective departments. In Informatics Engineering, this event’s name was CBS, which is stand for Character Building Season. Every departments had their own names, but I couldn’t mention them one by one.

Because I was one of MIPA Bersatu 2017 committees, so CBS committees allowed me and other MIPA Bersatu 2017 committees in CBS committees to have easy jobs. Coincidentally, Fikri and me were in the same division again in CBS committees. We were in medic division and worked with Senior Arie, Senior Muriz, Niya, Beryl, and Angga. On this day, Fikri and me only guarded medic room till the end of the day. Of course because it’s still first day so there was none of freshmen who was sick or hurt. Aaandd yeah I felt jobless in this day. Well, I hope my juniors will be always safe and healthy during CBS.
