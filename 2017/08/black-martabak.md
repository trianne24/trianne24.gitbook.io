# Black Martabak

Today I went to the opening ceremony of Informatics Festival aka IFest in Bale Santika’s footsal hall. At first, Senior Ojan as the project officer of IFest 2017 and Senior Hilmi as the vice presidents of Himatif gave an opening speech. After that the footsal competition started. At that time, I felt my body was sick, but when I saw my friends and talked with them, I felt better. I even tasted durian ice cup which name was Prima Duren. I really recommended you to eat this even though I had to admit this was very expensive for a mini size cup LOL.

When the sun was high I decided to go back to my temporary home because I didn’t want to get worse so I wanted to rest in my bed. The event hadn’t finished yet when I left but I wish everything will be okay till the end of IFest 2017.

At night I went to Jatos with Mila and eat our dinner there. Feeling not satisfied yet, we bought a box of black martabak. Yeah, I wasn’t joking. The martabak color was black because it flavored oreo. Inside of the martabak there were a lot of cheese, making it more delicious. This martabak we bought was sold in a martabak stall near Jatos. It didn’t only sell oreo flavor, but also green tea, red velvet, pandan, and many more. I really recommended this place for buying various flavored martabak. That’s it for today. I went to sleep faster today because I had to wake up early tomorrow.
