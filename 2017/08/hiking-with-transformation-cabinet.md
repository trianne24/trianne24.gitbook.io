# Hiking with Transformation Cabinet

Yesterday I said I slept faster than usual because I had to wake up early today. Yeah it’s true I had to go to Manglayang with Transformation Cabinet for an Upgrading program. I went to the meeting point which was in Brooklyn, Padjadjaran University, with Mila by riding her motorcycle. After waiting for a while, all participants of Upgrading program which were Transformation Cabinet people, went to Manglayang together using public cars. At Manglayang we hiked by our feet to Manglayang feet. I’m serious, we only reached Manglayang feet not the top of Manglayang. It made me felt very exhausted but better when we already arrived. At that time, I felt a lot of fresh air around me and it was really exciting.

After resting for a while, we were playing games. I became Senior Mella’s partner in all games that we played. There were two games we played right now: sack race and bringing marble on spoon inside our mouth race. Simply I said these games were two kind of games we played on Independence Day of Indonesia. Maybe because today is still in August, so we still feel the Independence Day vibes.

Then when the sun was high, we cooked Indomie and ate the noodles together from the pots. After eating, we continued the games. In this time, we played saying game which was testing our teams’ solidarity. That meant me and Senior Mella had to say something same together when the host said two things different. For example, the host would say “red or white?” and a team had to say “red” together or “white” together to win the game. I forgot how many stages we should passed to win this game but in the end me and Senior Mella didn’t win. The winner for all games from the beginning to the end was Mila and her partner Senior Monic. I laughed when I saw the winner got a certificate of winning these games. Such a cute!

Finally we took a photo together and went back to the public cars we used before under the Manglayang feet then we went back to each other home.
