# Github Page Phase 1

I just want to share that I finally created a Github Page as my personal website.&#x20;

{% embed url="https://trianne24.github.io/" %}

It's not much because I like it clean and simple. I embedded this college blog there for the sake of showing off my English skills and making the people who stalk me know that I like writing but I realize I should take it down later because a lot of stories are kinda embarrassing.

My next plan is to update my Medium blog for a collection of UI/UX case studies I've done but it will take time since I mostly don't work on a case study properly, I just let my brain juice flow while doing the research and immediately pour my thoughts into designs lmao.
