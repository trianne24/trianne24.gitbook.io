# Another Gambling on HIPSMU 2020

HIPSMU (Hibah Inovasi Pre-Startup Mahasiswa Unpad) or in English it's an internal competition held by Padjadjaran University to fund their students who have great startup ideas. I said "gambling" because again, this was an impulsive activity as this was my last year as a bachelor's degree student.

Anyway it was kinda a random competition in my university, I think it was the first time this competition was held and then it continued as an annual program by Padjadjaran University's OoRANGE Center of Business Incubator. The competition prize was big and when my lecturer Mrs. Mira recommended me and my friends Rifqy and Raihan to join using Monica as the startup idea, I agreed to join immediately. It didn't take us long to prepare because we had the app design and budget plan so we literally only needed to create the startup proposal.

But we were all busy for our thesis so after we won the prize, we didn't take care of this account anymore or even make Monica to be an actual startup ðŸ˜…
