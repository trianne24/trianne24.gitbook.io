# Moving to Campus Dormitory

I got an offer to move to my campus dormitory for free because they wanted to make sure the students were still healthy during COVID-19 situation. Of course I took the offer immediately. I hated my temporary home because the WiFi sucked there and my parents kept bugging me to come home asap because I took too long to finish my thesis.

Not much to tell yeah, I was so happy here we also got free food and I could order food delivery anytime with no curfew.
