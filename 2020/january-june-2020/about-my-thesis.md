# About My Thesis

I finally finished my thesis! I'm not really proud of the journey because I lied a lot and I had a lot of depressed moments too online and irl but yep, fake it till you make it. I also kinda rushed everything just to finish this thesis and it's far from the perfect result that I wanted.

I come from the future to write this blog post so I forgot if I have ever mentioned something about my thesis here. The title is "REVAMPING THE USER INTERFACE OF INSTITUTIONAL DIGITAL REPOSITORY SITE USING THE USER EXPERIENCE AND INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS (CASE STUDY: KANDAGA FROM PADJADJARAN UNIVERSITY)". Basically it was about revamping my university's digital repository website. I came up with this topic because in the 4 years of being a student in this university, there were a lot of redundant digital repository websites. They were also not being managed properly so the database was outdated and incomplete. It's a shame because other universities have a good digital repository website and they're very useful so I hope the same thing for my university too. Someone must start this revamp project asap and that person was me.

All of the redundant digital repository websites were combined into one name which is Kandaga. Kandaga means a storage place or container in Sundanese. In this case, "Kandaga Unpad" refers to the website that stores valuable resources to support academics especially past final projects (diploma's projects, bachelor's undergraduate theses, master's theses, and doctoral dissertations) and many scientific works such as books, journals, etc. Later after I graduated, I checked the website and it was expanded not just for an e-library but also an archive for Padjadjaran University's collections.

The website design has been changed a lot since I suggested the revamp idea but I don't really mind honestly, as long as this project isn't abandoned. I mean, I'm not even sure if I want to come back to Jatinangor to help with this revamp project again. I'm glad enough that I've been the initiator who sparked the motivations to the official staff to work on this revamp project.
