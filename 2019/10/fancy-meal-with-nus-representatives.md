# Fancy Meal with NUS Representatives

Today I came to the office of IO Unpad because it's required to come each week to visit the staffs. I was scheduled to visit every Wednesday but because I had some practical studies on that day, I chose Friday to be my visit day. At least Friday was the last day of the weekdays and even though I had to deal with some offsite internship tasks, Tiffany wouldn't bother me too much like the other weekdays haha :(

Today is very special. NUS representatives came to Padjadjaran University. I didn't really understand the purpose of the visit but it should be a partnership issue since Dr. Ronny was there to accompany them. Dr. Ronny invited all who were in the office to accompany NUS representatives too including me. I thought it would be like a regular meeting but we were doing it in BGG (Bandung Giri Gahana Golf and Resort). I always wondered what was inside BGG and today I went there. It was an elite place for meeting with a prestigious restaurant inside. The meeting was already done before so I went to BGG just for lunch time.

To be honest, I was embarrassed to join the lunch with NUS representatives because I wore ugly clothes that I randomly picked. This was too sudden and understandable if I didn't wear a batik but I wished I could wear more pretty clothes to meet honored people from NUS. Luckily, nobody cared about it LOL. Dr. Ronny even praised me a lot in front of NUS representatives because I contributed a lot in publication designs.

The food was definitely delicious! Too bad the people didn't take it all so Mrs. Iceu, one of the staff of IO Unpad, wrapped the food and let the interns take it home. I took the capcay because I liked capcay a lot lately. After the lunch time, NUS representatives and Dr. Ronny were going to continue the meeting. Red, Dinda, and me went back to the office. Ah yeah by the way we took a photo together with Mrs. Iceu and Rashela. Rashela and Alle were chosen to accompany Dr. Ronny but Alle was nowhere when we took the photo.
