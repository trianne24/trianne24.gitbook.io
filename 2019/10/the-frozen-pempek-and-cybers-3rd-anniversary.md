# The Frozen Pempek and Cyberâ€™s 3rd Anniversary

Today my generation Cyber is having an anniversary party. Cyber has already been together for three years since October 22, 2016! I have to admit that my generation is one of the most bonded generations in my department.

I didn't go to the anniversary party from the beginning. I planned to finish my offsite internship tasks first. If I couldn't finish the work before 6 PM, I intended to not go to the anniversary party. I did my best and chose to order some foods via GoFood. I ordered pempek because I was interested in the price. It was cheaper than the other pempek menus I found in GoFood. That time I didn't know the pempek that I bought was not fried and it was frozen food. Luckily I bought two kinds of pempek menus from that shop and one of them was edible so I still could eat without ordering more foods.

The frozen pempek that I bought was brought to Elsa's place after I tried to finish my offsite internship works. Yeah, I said "tried" because I didn't really finish my job, that's why I brought my macbook as well. I went to Elsa's temporary home and entrusted my pempek to her fridge. We talked a lot about random things and Elsa was trying to make me watch Games of Thrones haha. I don't know if I have time for watching those series. I spent about two hours in her place and it was surprising because Cyber's anniversary party was still going on.

After a lot of chats, I went to the party which was in the parking park of PPBS D. There weren't a lot of my friends there. They said some of them already left early and there were some people like me who came only at night. In this night session, some of them were watching a horror movie and the others were busy with the satay grilling(?). There were also some guys who played guitar and sang random songs. I joined the horror movie gang. The movie title was "May the Devil Take You". It was an Indonesian horror movie. Even though the casts were kinda ridiculous, I still had to show off my thumbs on this movie because it was good. I didn't watch from the beginning though because I was late but I would like to see it again someday...when I become braver LOL. I am a fan of horror stuff but I still don't really like watching horror movies on my own.

When the movie ended, the foods which were prepared by the people who were busy with the satay grilling were ready. I didn't really like to eat rice though because it was already too late to eat heavy carbohydrate foods so I just ate the grilled sausages and meatballs. After that, all the people there took a photo together. There's nothing really special with the night session of the anniversary party. I missed the party's main event which was the cake slicing and fun games. Those were only for the morning session and I couldn't come.

I guess this will be the last anniversary party that my generation held because this will be our last semester going to college for study! The next semester will be filled with thesis shits.
