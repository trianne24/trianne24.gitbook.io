# Letâ€™s Achieve More, Shall We?

CBS is happening again this year as always but right now I am not the committee anymore. I am invited as one of the speakers for a talkshow about competitions in computer science field to be exact. The other speakers besides me are Senior Fazlur and Hasna. There was also Ahsan who became the moderator of the talkshow. Here's my story about being a speaker today.

Before Hasna was chosen, Senior Dicky was asked to be a speaker but he couldn't make it. To be honest, I didn't expect that Hasna would be one of the speakers as well. It was true that I didn't like her existence (for some reasons, she is annoying) but that wasn't my reason. I admitted, Hasna had a lot of awards but most of them were not in computer science field. She only tried one competition and luckily she won. She didn't win it by herself but there were also Syafira and Hilya. Shofi could be counted as well since the idea of the app came from her although she wasn't in the team. I felt Sachi was more suitable because I admired Sachi lately since he won in many competitions but still was an underrated person in our department. I could understand Sachi very well, when you became outstanding but people didn't praise you. Sachi never thought about it and that's why I liked his personality above Hasna.

I actually didn't like how the committee gave a briefing to the speakers in the chat group they made. Also when we met before the talkshow started, they still didn't brief what to say clearly. Luckily, Ahsan who already became moderator many times, help the briefing so that everything became clear started from the order of the questions, how to answer the questions from CBS participants, etc. I also helped them to tidy up the presentation slides that they shared to us.

The talkshow went well. I appreciated a lot to CBS participants because I saw a lot of potentials. They asked many good questions to the speakers and even made the speakers surprised. I wish the enthusiasm still continues after this talkshow.

The speakers and moderator took a photo together after that. We also give thanks to the committees for this chance. Senior Fazlur, Hasna, and Ahsan went back early but I was still stand by there until the CBS meetup ended. It was because I didn't realise that I talked too much with the committees that I met there. I felt like I never talked to my juniors anymore this year. Standing by there was kinda lucky too for me because I could go back to my temporary home by Radit's motorcycle. He was there because he was the steering committee this time.
