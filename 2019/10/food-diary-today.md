# Food Diary Today

Today I tried new food and drink that I never ate before. I ate rice with beef minced meat from Buki and drank cheese tea from Koma. They both had a simple name for a brand LOL. The food was tasty but too expensive because the portion didn't make me full. The cheese tea was the best. I never tried cheese tea before so I thought I would like to try another cheese tea.

I really didn't know what to say anymore... Sorry I'm not a good reviewer haha. God... I think I should reconsider to do food reviewing lesser.
