# Hokben But Cheaper?

I found a precious treasure on the GoFood menu today. There was a new restaurant in GoFood named Bentoudash. It was located in Kampus Foodcourt. I only went there once with the core committees of CBS 2018 so I didn't really remember each of the stalls there. Kampus Foodcourt was a place where food stalls were opened. It's like a food festival but inside a place which could be used as a workspace.

Bentoudash offered only a few food menu since it was still new but all of them were cheap. I was interested to try because the food was Japanese. Japanese food never fails my tongue haha. I ordered rice and teriyaki and this was better than I expected. I directly recommended this to my gang and Hilya. Too bad that this restaurant was closed too fast. The moment when I got my orders, the restaurant was closed.

Additional note: The hell dude I was so lucky I could taste this food but the restaurant is rarely opened whenever I check the GoFood menu. Every time I saw it was closed I felt like I wanted to say, "Please don't be lazy, open the restaurant please." to the owner.
