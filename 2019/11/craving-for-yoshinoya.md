# Craving for Yoshinoya

The first and the last time I ate Yoshinoya was when I watched Captain Marvel with IO Unpad interns and Dr. Ronny. Since then, I have been craving Yoshinoya a lot. But because Yoshinoya was expensive I never tried to order it. This time I was lucky because Yoshinoya made a promising promotion. I didn't really want to mention the price but I could get one box for approx. 20 thousands rupiahs. It wasn't really cheap if I had to compare with the food that I usually ordered, but if I compared it with the normal price of a Yoshinoya box, it's definitely worth it and I also got some discounts. The promotion was a bundle of three crispy chicken rice boxes. Three boxes were too much but I could keep it for two days haha.

This menu was different from the one that I ate last time, which was a beef bowl, but damn this Yoshinoya box was soooo delicious. I don’t know how to explain this. The egg mayonnaise was the best one. I felt that’s already enough for me to just eat rice with the mayonnaise haha.

I wish this kind of promotion will come back again in the future.
