# Late Icompas

Icompas is one of the programs handled by the Professions Department of Himatif. It is made specially for third year students so this year is Delphi generation's chance. I didn't participate in Icompas when Cyber got the chance last year because I was sick. I actually forgot why I didn't participate though. It should be more than just sick but yeah whatever. Delphi was lucky because they got to visit Tokopedia and Dana office. The chosen companies were better than last year's and I didn't want to miss this opportunity anymore. Dzakia offered me to participate because she was the ex-head of the Professions Department of Himatif. After that, I contacted Agnes, the current head of the Professions Department of Himatif to talk about what I should do and bring.

We were gathered in PPBS D when the sun rose. Even though I was the only senior here, I felt happy because Delphi welcomed me so much. They invited me in conversations. They also invited me to join in the photoshoot before we went to Jakarta. I also had fun on the way to Jakarta. Here's the photo.

The first company we visited was Dana. Dana presented us with a small seminar to talk about how Dana engineers and product team work. Agnes told us that I could apply for a Dana internship because it's for 6 months and I would be free of college life after this semester. Well I am not sure if I want to apply for a new internship job again. I need to rest but I can consider it LOL. We also had lunch in Dana and took a photo together.

There should be an office tour too but it was aborted because we would be late to go to Tokopedia tower. Yes, the second company we visited was Tokopedia. Dana and Tokopedia had a similar office like Kargo, which was in a building with the other companies there. Tokopedia's building was actually built only for Tokopedia though, that's why it was Tokopedia Tower. I called that kind of building a workspace. But Tokopedia's security was quite complicated because we had to get the access card one by one by giving our ID card while we could get the special route to Dana office before. Because of that, I was late to see the seminar by Tokopedia. Well actually the seminar was boring. I even got sleepy. After that, we got an office tour of the Tokopedia office. Tokopedia's workplace was sooo damn cool. They had sofas and more sofas and kitchen and playing room and kids playground and open area and many more. We took a photo again in the open area with the Tokopedia mural.

After that we went back to Jatinangor. In the middle of the way, we stopped at the rest area to buy some snacks. And that's my story about Icompas! I'm sorry it's not detailed because I can't be very expressive haha. Thanks to Agnes and Dzakia who let me participate in this program.
