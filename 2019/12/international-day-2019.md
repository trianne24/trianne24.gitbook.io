# International Day 2019

International Day is one of the annual events organised by IO Unpad to provide a global understanding and insights to the guests, especially Padjadjaran University's students. Students could interact with various students from abroad to learn how to respect and appreciate the cultural differences from various countries. This event also provided information about scholarship, exchange, and foreign language test agencies. I am too lazy to explain in more detail but you can check it [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5iCLVNl8yk/) and [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5z9Uu\_F3Eh/). It's my design tho. There's also the promotional poster below.

As one of the designer team members, my job was to provide all designs for International Day. It was fun to think of a lot of awesome ideas but tiring. I also didn't know how to handle the printing jobs because I didn't have anyone to accompany me. On the previous day before the event, I finally managed to finish all design tasks for International Day including the printing jobs.

To be honest I never joined any international event by IO Unpad because I prioritised my study. Today was my first time but in this event, I didn't really have many jobs. I only had to help Vietnam and Cambodia students preparing the food stand. Yes, the international students from each country had to open a food stand. Food stand was one of the competitions that international students competed on. I felt glad because they could talk in Indonesian better than English but it's kinda weird to talk in Indonesian to people who weren't Indonesian.

Because I didn't really have many jobs, I made myself busy with cutting stickers for IO Unpad's stand. I liked the style of the stickers so much. It's actually an immediate idea of me to have a kind of merchandise for people who came to our office's stand. Besides cutting stickers, I also accompanied Fikri walking around the countries' stands. I got some good food from some stands even though it's not too many. Because this event was for the public, it's too crowded there. Even reporters came to see this event.

The food stands only opened until 1 PM. Every international student should prepare for the next competition which was the art performance. All interns including me who didn't have anything to do could go inside Bale Sawala. I was kinda sleepy watching the art performances though. After all countries had already performed, there were doorprizes time and winners announcement. Finally, IO Unpad's interns got their own stage. First, Nida and the girls danced and then the dancers including the other interns who didn't dance before pulling everyone in Bale Sawala to follow the dance. We did a flashmob!

The International Day event finished successfully this year. IO Unpad's interns took a photo together.

Even though I didn't win any doorprize, I got a cute sticky note box and Griya vouchers which were given separately just for the interns. Then everyone went back home. I was shocked because there were many rice boxes left in the office. I decided to take several boxes and gave them to the people in IDeA's meeting today. Yes, I was going to IDeA's meeting. I wasn't sure if I could be counted as IDeA's member though, I never went to the community's meetups. I just went there because I didn't want to waste those rice boxes and also I just wanted to say hi to the new community president Luthfi haha.
