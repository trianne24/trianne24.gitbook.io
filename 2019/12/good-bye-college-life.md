# Good Bye College Life

Today is the last day of my college life. Today I had the latest final test in my college life, Project Management. This subject was a mistake. My generation was forced to choose this subject while actually it was not mandatory for us. I didn't like how unrelated this subject was with the other subjects that I learned before. For the last time, I studied hard last night and could be optimistic with the result of the final test.

Because this is the last time of Cyber's college life too, Malik and Intan held a small gathering for us in Wasabi restaurant. At first I didn't want to buy any food or drink because I would go to a buffet but I gave up because I started to be hungry. I only bought fries though. There's no special discussion topic in this small gathering. And then, we took a photo together to celebrate our last time in college.

As I said above I would go to a buffet because it was already planned with my gang even before Malik and Intan announced the small gathering. We were going to Hanamasa in Bandung. Because there's some personal urges of the gang members, some of us who were ready gathered at Iyon's temporary home. I used that chance to go back to my place for a while. Finally, we were going to Hanamasa. There were only Rifqy, Faizin, Raihan, Iyon, Fauzi, Angga and me.

We were kinda late because Hanamasa was fully booked but luckily we still could book as the last order. We even got two tables side by side because 7 people were too many for only one table. To be honest this was the first time I went to Hanamasa. I thought Hanamasa wasn't a buffet restaurant. I enjoyed every kind of meat there until my stomach was full. There wasn't any rule about how long we could stay and finish every food on our table without any left like in Kintan Buffet. However, we still had to respect the restaurant. At first, Fauzi refused to join because he didn't want to spend a lot of money but he is satisfied now. He even took some videos when we were eating. We also contacted Shofi who was still in South Korea. Finally, we took a photo together. I wasn't in many photos but I had one here.

My stomach hurt so much after I went back from Hanamasa but at least I was happy. I had to say thanks for my gang especially to Faizin who wanted to pay half of my bill. I need to pay him back sooner.
