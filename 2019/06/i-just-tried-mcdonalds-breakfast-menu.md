# I Just Tried McDonaldâ€™s Breakfast Menu

Thanks to GoFood, I could taste McDonald's menu in Jatinangor. Damn, being in Jatinangor wasn't really good without McDonald's. Although we had KFC but sometimes we needed McD because both of the restaurants had their own unique menu. For example, McD had cool breakfast menus. I never tasted its breakfast menu because I never went to McD or ordered McD online in the morning. So this is my first time.

I ordered a pack with chicken McMuffin, hash brown snack, and a cup of coffee. I love the taste but I'm so damn broke.

To be honest, I respected the driver who delivered my order from McD in Cibiru to my temporary home. He said that he delivered my order at the same time as escorting his child to school. All the best to you Sir!
