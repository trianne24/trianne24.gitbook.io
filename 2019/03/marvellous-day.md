# Marvellous Day

The perks of being IO interns: getting treated by the head of IO Unpad as our allowance!

Today, the IO interns including me were watching Captain Marvel in the cinema and having dinner with the head of IO Unpad in Yoshinoya. Several days ago, we arranged this since dr. Ronny said that he was free and wanted to treat us because of our works so far. Not all of the interns joined this party, even I had doubt too before because there would be a general meeting of TEDxUnpad event and I really wanted to come. I was being a volunteer for TEDxUnpad too by the way, but I will tell about this later after the event ends. Because Senior Rhe, who was the general managers of IO interns and also one of the volunteers of TEDxUnpad event, convinced me to join the party so I decided to join the party first. She said that usually general meeting would start late like any other committees.

We went to the cinema in Jatos. I joined dr. Ronny’s car ride since I was still in the university so I just had to walk to the IO office to join the car ride. We already bought the tickets earlier this morning so we just needed to get to the cinema in Jatos several minutes before the movie started. Jatinangor’s road in the afternoon is usually full of vehicles so dr. Ronny cut the way to go to Jatos. It violated the street rules but dr. Ronny said that he should do this so that we could watch in time and as long as we didn’t get caught, we were safe. LOL he said that so easy. I really liked his easy-going personality.

In the cinema hall, dr. Ronny didn’t just pay the tickets but he also treated us with popcorn and ice lemon tea! Aw, that’s too much. We also took these photos together.

Aaandd…finally we could get into the cinema studio room. To be honest I didn’t understand what’s going on in the MCU timeline so I might not enjoy Captain Marvel as good as those who followed the entire timeline. Fortunately Captain Marvel itself didn’t tell anything about what happened in MCU after the Infinity War, so I didn’t have to be worried about the MCU problems. Because of watching this, I became interested to watch all of MCU’s movies started from Iron Man to Avengers: Infinity War. Yes, I even didn’t watch Infinity War because I didn’t follow the trends. Marvel Cinematic Universe has become more and more popular, and the last Avengers movie which told about Infinity War, was the peak of the universe plotline. People said Captain Marvel would be the new hero(ine) to save the problems that occurred because of the Infinity War in the next Avengers movie. Well let’s see if that’s happened.

After watching the movie, dr. Ronny also treated us Yoshinoya as our dinner. At that time we also celebrated his birthday. I actually wouldn’t know that dr. Ronny had his birthday lately if Senior Vinsca and others didn’t buy the birthday cake for him. By the way, the Yoshinoya’s rice bowl was sooooo tasty and I really liked this more than any Japanese rice food I ever had. I thought that’s why the price was very expensive just for a frickin’ rice bowl.

In the same time, I was worried about TEDxUnpad general meeting since I didn’t have internet quota to check my LINE, but I tried to keep calm since Senior Rhe was still in Yoshinoya. The dinner time didn’t take a long time and dr. Ronny had left earlier. After that I was escorted by Adinnov to the meeting venue, which was in Bale Pabukon. I was late, but I was kinda relieved that I chose to join the party before going to the general meeting. That meeting was so boring. If only not because I wanted to meet everyone in my design division, I wouldn’t come.
