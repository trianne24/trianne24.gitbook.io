# First Time Infused

My first day in Kargo was on January 8, right after the interview session on the previous day. And today, I just worked for a week but I got an accident that really made me shocked.

Kargo is the best. The office let the employees to get free lunch without deducting our salary. The lunch is served by a culinary service and I don’t want to mention the name of it. What can I say is, this culinary service made me like eggplant so much. The lunch was always completely various from the rice to the side dishes. Although the food seemed weird since I never try it, the taste was always delicious.

Today’s lunch was also delicious but there’s a problem. I got a stomachache after eating the lunch. At first time I thought that it was because the period time but I felt the urge to throw up. A lot. I was not the only person that felt it and it let the whole office suspected on today’s lunch. Man, seriously the vomit was scary. The color was old green. Some of the employees that couldn’t hold the vomit decided to go to the hospital as soon as possible. I was offered to go to the hospital too. At first I rejected it because it’s nearly the going home time. But I still couldn’t hold the vomit after throwing up several times so I decided to go to the hospital in the second trip. The employees who offered me before were already gone in the first trip.

I felt sorry to Mr. Mario who escorted me to the hospital with his car because I couldn’t hold the vomit even in the car so I throwed up several times in his car’s trash bin. I was brought to the emergency room where the employees who were already arrived first already got their treatment. Not longer after that I was getting infused. That was my first time! The nurse took my blood and put a needle through my veins. At first it was painful because I felt that the position of the needle was unstable but when the intravenous fluids went through my blood I felt so refreshed.

After getting infused with two infusion bags, I got my medical record. The doctors said that my blood was one of the worst from the other employees. I might have to be infused again for the next two days. Whoa whoa whoa. I couldn’t imagine if I really rejected the offer to go to the hospital before. I took my medicines and I was relieved that the medical treatment was paid by Kargo but I felt shocked because the bill was too expensive and there were more than one employee including me!

Finally, I was escorted back to the office because I left my bag there. After that, I went back home using GrabCar that was paid by Kargo. I made my parents got worried about me but fortunately I managed to tell them what happened. I chose to take one day off because of this. Lucky me, I didn’t have to be infused again for the next two days but I had to drink a lot of water and take the medicines on time to keep my blood clean.
