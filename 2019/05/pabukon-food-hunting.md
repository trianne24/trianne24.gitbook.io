# Pabukon Food Hunting

Every year this month, Bale Pabukon’s front yard is used to be a food festival. This is because this month is usually the holy month for Muslims to fast. Fast is their ritual to not eat or drink for several times, about 12 hours in Indonesia, and they will break the ritual on Maghrib time and they can also say it’s iftar time.

I knew today was not the first day of Bale Pabukon’s food festival but I only had free time today. I went to the food festival along with Islam, Senior Fatan, and Senior Atep. When we arrived there, we were separated from each other. I bought mango sticky rice and potato chips\(?\) from there. I actually liked all the foods there because they were so unique and looked tasty, but I had to choose. There was also a stall who sold octopuses\(?\) but it’s too crowded and I didn’t think I could get it before it was closed.

The mango sticky rice I bought was my very first mango sticky rice I had eaten. To be honest, it was very expensive for this portion. The potato chips I bought were from the stall that Danis and friends opened. Danis was one of my friends in the visual design division of PEF last year. I bought at his stall because I wanted to talk to him and he was always boasting about his stall in the chat group.

My review on these foods were… yeah too great to be eaten. Unfortunately, these foods were only served once a year and I might never see these again another year. Jeez, if only IFEST stall was as good as the other. They were suck at marketing and food research.
