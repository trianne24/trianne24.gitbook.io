# Two Iftar Sessions

Today I will review my experiences in the two iftars that I joined.

The first iftar was the one with my generation Cyber 2016. It was in the house of Ilham's grandma in Bandung. After participating in the PFF 2.0 event, we went there using our motorcycles, including me but I was escorted not riding one.

By the way PFF 2.0 was the event held by the Professions Department of Himatif exclusively for our generation to get the experience in the work interview session and I was sure they were all disappointed with our generation because there weren't so many of us participating in this event. I could feel the reason why my friends in my generation were too lazy because we were going to the iftar in Bandung so most of Bandung people preferred to stay in Bandung rather than got exhausted riding to Jatinangor. In my opinion, PFF 2.0 was not really interesting too because most Cyber 2016 members already got the interview experience from Interpersonal Skills subject in the last semester. I expected that PFF 2.0's interviewers were using English but wow they just used Indonesian. Very impractical for us who are targeting startups and big IT companies.

Because it was in Bandung so the journey to get there and back from there was quite tiring. But the foods that Ilham's grandma shared for us were tasty. From snacks, main dishes, to the desserts, everything was good. After that we also took photos together.

The next iftar session that I joined was with my gang, Subcribe Iyonalf or we usually just said Subcribe. Yes, it was "subcribe" and not "subscribe" because that's how Iyon said it. We were being a gang because of the same goal and same interests. We chose Iyon as our gang's model because he got a Youtube channel and it was "cool". Started from the second year, we actually never went for a day out. Today my gang were gathered for another iftar session but too bad we couldn't bring Naufal and Dio. Actually we planned this iftar session long before our generation's plan but since we should respect our generation so we delayed this iftar session and we went for it a day after our generation's iftar session. So basically, we went for an iftar session two times in a row.

We held this simple iftar session in Shawaregna, an all-you-can-eat restaurant that served local foods such as fried rice, batagor, noodles, and many more. It was based on Rifqy's recommendation. The price was quite cheap if I had to say, because I could eat almost all of the food variants just about 50 thousand rupiahs. The taste of the food was also good. I would like to go to this place again someday.

While waiting for the eaten food to be digested, we played the Undercover game. The person who lost should eat Fauzi's leftover food. LOL we had so much fun on this game. Fauzi was bad at this game but because we felt bad, we still helped him to finish his food.

Finally we got back to our place. Well, I felt sorry for those who rode the motorcycle because they rode for Jatinangor-Bandung trip two days in a row.
