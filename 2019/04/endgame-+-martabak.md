# Endgame + Martabak

Today me and the IO interns were watching the most wanted movie of this decade. It's Avengers: Endgame. Aah, thanks to the [last movie party](../03/marvellous-day.md) I got interested in MCU and caught up the whole plot by watching all of the MCU movies in marathon. I felt happy that I could watch and understand Endgame haha. Tbh, this movie was cool, especially the jokes inside the movie. There were lots of plot twists that I never thought before and the most heartbreaking moment that I never really wanted. I won't tell a lot because I might spoil the movie ðŸ˜¬ I'm not good at keeping the spoiler although I actually just want to tell my commentary about the movie. I guess I can't be a movie reviewer haha.

Dr. Ronny left earlier so we didn't have dinner time again like before. After watching the movie, some of the interns went for dinner but I chose to go to my temporary home as soon as possible. I just didn't want to hassle myself because there weren't any of us who drove a car or motorcycle to go to the dinner place, which was at Pujasera Ciseke. Besides, I could walk on my own from Jatos so I chose to go back and enjoy my dinner time by myself.

When I arrived at my temporary home, I searched for good food on GoFood and I found there was a promotion on martabak with three different flavours. Best of all, I could choose what flavours that I wanted. Dayummm! I chose the cheese, milk, and banana flavours and the black colored dough. Here's the photo of it. Seriously, this was the best martabak that I'd ever had. Also, one box contains many pieces of martabak and it's worth it. I would like to buy from this martabak restaurant again.
