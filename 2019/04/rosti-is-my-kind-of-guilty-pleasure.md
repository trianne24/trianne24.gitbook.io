# Rosti Is My Kind of Guilty Pleasure

Today my division in TEDxUnpad, the design division, had a meeting in Kunst. Kunst was a restaurant, an elite one to be exact. I'd heard from my friends who had visited there, the price of the foods were very expensive. I was worried but I would like to see myself.

The first person who arrived at the place was the head of the division, Laras. I was the second one. Before the others came, I talked a lot with her randomly. Then Sarah came and the last one was Farah. Farah was very late, she said that she overslept but as long as we could finally meet, I didn't bother with that. Oh yes, actually we had one more member but she quitted. I forgot her name but yeah whatever.

In this meeting we talked mostly about how bad the work of the other divisions in TEDxUnpad. I won't say which divisions, but damn, I could feel that my division was the best of all. I hated the sponsorship division the most. Jeez, it made me remember how bad PEF was because of the sponsorship division. As the design division, of course we could do nothing but keep our best in designs. We were complaining a lot, even Laras as the head of the division, but that's the reason why we met here. Sarah was the person who spoke a lot about this. She was in the same year with me and of course she already got a lot of experiences in committees. I learned the use of "telemarketer" thing from Sarah. (Telemarketer is like a service to help us getting sponsors, yeah something like that.)

Ah, anyway I wanted to review the food in Kunst. Laras recommended this food and I hated to say that I really loved it. The name of the food was "rosti". I just googled it and it wasn't an Indonesian name. It should be rösti or rööschti and it was a Swiss dish. I could describe this food as a potato pancake. I ordered rosti with smoked beef toppings and it was an awesome experience to get this for my stomach.

Laras, at the same time, ordered rosti too but she chose vegetable toppings. I didn't like her taste but maybe I should try later if only I got more money haha. The price? Tbh, it was expensive but not as expensive as my friends told me before. As long as I didn't order the beverage I thought just food was enough.
