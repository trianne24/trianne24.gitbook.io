# The Supervisors Finally Meet Up

Today the supervisors of IO Unpad’s interns were having a meeting. This might be my first time to dive on this responsibility because I lost so many moments when I was still working in Jakarta. And to be honest, I wasn’t really focused on the meeting because I had to do some Kargo tasks.

Oh yeah by the way let me introduce the supervisors first. There are Red or Abdurrahman as the general manager, Dinda as the vice general manager, Shabby as the supervisor of translating, Afi as the supervisor of social media management, Yasmin as the supervisor of content writing, Kristin as the supervisor of liaising, Cat or Catherina as the supervisor of event management, and me as the supervisor of graphic design. We are all the past interns of the first batch in 2019. The interns are chosen each semester, and now we manage the interns of the second batch in 2019. We were chosen as the supervisors by the past supervisors of the first batch in 2019. In the future, we have to choose candidates for the next supervisors. By the way, we like to call us “Spv” which stands for supervisors in short. The name of our group chat is “Spv lelolelo” and that’s just a random name came from Afi’s brain.

The meeting was held in Afi’s room. Afi lived in the Easton Park apartment. The apartment was not as big and cool as I thought, but the room that Afi rented was quite comfortable. The meeting was about the progress and plan of each division and the general manager-vice general manager too. It didn’t take a long time to discuss in the meeting and after that we talked about random things. We also took a photo together. Whoops I just realised that Red was the only man in the supervisors team. He posted this in his Instagram story and captioned it as “harem” LOL.
