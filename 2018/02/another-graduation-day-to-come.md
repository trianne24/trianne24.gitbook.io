# Another Graduation Day to Come

Padjadjaran University always held a graduation day every year for four times and today was the first time of the year. I wanted to go there because some seniors I knew were graduated today. I told to Internal Relation Department that I could make it and then they invited me into volunteers multichat. The purpose of that multichat was to keep in touch with all volunteers and make sure they would accompanied the graduates that they chose to the starting point before we went to the Himatif crowds. I chose to accompany Senior Fieny with Afifah and Abie. Actually I didn’t want to go there because I had a duty but I didn’t have any alibi to reject it.

When the day came, I had already planned myself to not go there too soon. So I spent my time before going to the graduation day with my special one. After that I went there and when I arrived, it seemed that the graduation day hadn’t started. Wow, I thought that I was late.

After the graduation ceremony in Grha Sanusi hall was finished, me and the other volunteers waited in front of the hall to pick up the graduates. At that time, Afifah and Abie weren’t arrived yet. WTF I thought that I could trust this duty to them but in the end it was just me who accompanied Senior Fieny. To be honest, it was really difficult to find graduated woman because almost all of them wore hijab. I found Senior Fieny when she was already in the starting point of Himatif crowds. So I almost did nothing because Senior Fieny was already went there by herself without my help.

After I had done this duty, I directly left Himatif crowds and went to other place. I met Senior Tiar, Senior Rifka, and Senior Wiwi and went to Senior Yuli’s graduation. We took a photo together. If only there were Senior Aleza at that time, we would be a complete Media Department family of Transformation Cabinet.

By the way, I hadn’t mentioned the seniors I knew that were graduated today right? They were Senior Lukman as the president of Transformation Cabinet, Senior Yulian as the vice president of Transformation Cabinet, Senior Abid as the head of sector who led publication and documentation in MIPA Bersatu 2017, Senior Yuli that I mentioned above, and Senior Friscilia as my mentor.

After I finished had fun with Media Department family of Transformation Cabinet, I met Viona. Viona was also one of Senior Friscilia’s mentees like me. Actually I almost had to go back to Jatinangor because Senior Friscilia looked like very busy and I couldn’t meet her. She was quite popular LOL even Viona which was in the same department with Senior Friscilia couldn’t talk for just a little time with her. While waiting the opportunity came, Viona and me bought a teddy bear and flowers for Senior Friscilia. After that finally we could met and took a photo together. That was all for today. After that I went back to Jatinangor with the one and only my man. Of course with a motorcycle LOL not public cars like the last graduation day I attended.
