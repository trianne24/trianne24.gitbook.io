# All Trainings in Indonesia NEXT 2018

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/images (2).jpg>)

IndonesiaNEXT is an annual event held by Telkom Indonesia and its subgroups. Padjadjaran University is one of the universities that established cooperation with Telkom Indonesia so that’s why every year IndonesiaNEXT in Bandung will be held in Padjadjaran University. I felt so stupid that [last year](../../2017/10/indonesianext-2017.md) I only joined the seminar but not the courses because there were certifications for Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator mastery. I could choose some certifications I liked back then. But this year, they don’t serve those certifications anymore and there aren’t some courses to choose. They decide to only serve two certifications: Google Ads Fundamentals and Microsoft Office Excel 2013. So let me tell you about those two courses.

The first certification, Google Ads Fundamentals, is actually free. You can make a Google account by yourself and you even can cheat because the questions are kinda similar with other participants. You can try several times too to get the highest score. This certification is only issued for a year. After that, you can retake the test to extend the certification. Basically this certification is bullshit although I had to admit most of the questions in the test were already discussed in the course classes so the certification test was going well.

The second certification, Microsoft Office Excel 2013, is kinda fun. I found a lot of secrets that I never knew about Microsoft Office Excel. The certification test was also cool. It’s like I was using the Excel simulator. The course class was also useful, although I had some troubles going to the classes, because almost all of the questions in the test were already discussed. The certification test was not free so I was so grateful that I could join a paid certification. It was basically from Certiport which provided not only Excel certification but all of Microsoft Office products along with CorelDraw and AutoCAD (cmiiw, I kinda forget sorry). Here is my [certification proof](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/2ef119c3-24ed-4cdd-b0d8-42f1a2fa0db4/linked\_in\_profile) y’all haha. I share this because I’m truly proud not like the first certification.

While doing those certifications I was accompanied with Shofi, Senior Ojan, and Senior Ojan’s friend from Telkom University (please forgive me if I’m wrong). Actually the journey of IndonesiaNEXT this year was not stopped there. There was one more test and it was about presentation and communication skill. I dropped out from this point because I didn’t want to skip more college classes anymore and I had achieved the certifications I wanted. But the other three of us continued their journey.

From more than 300 Bandung people to 100 people after Google certification then 40 people after Excel certification and finally those 40 people would be eliminated into 10 finalists by selecting from presentation and communication skill test. Same as the first two certifications, before showing off their skill in front of the judges those 40 people would have some course classes about that. Shofi and Senior Ojan had to skip many college classes so that they could prepare for this serious test. Too bad, no one from those three were selected as the 10 finalists of Bandung. As far as I know, those 10 finalists will be quarantined for intensive training and compete with the other finalists from other cities.

So yeah, our journey ends here. Whoa, it’s rare to see that I write this much LOL.
