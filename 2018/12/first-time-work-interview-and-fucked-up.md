# FIRST TIME WORK INTERVIEW AND FUCKED UP

I really wanted to forget this damn day.

As a privilege of being winners from [GEMASTIK 11](../11/gemastik-11.md), my team got a chance to be interns in Shopee. Shopee contacted us and today was the interview day. Because of that, Rifqy, Raihan and me had to skip some events like Huawei ICT test and Software Development practical presentation. We were going to Jakarta this morning using Primajasa bus.

Hereâ€™s my stupidity: I never used Transjakarta bus anymore since I was in junior high school. That time, Transjakarta was just introduced and we didnâ€™t have to make any card to go inside. Because of that I bought a card and paid for Rifqy and Raihan as well. As a person who lived so long in Jakarta since I was born, I didnâ€™t know a lot of places in Jakarta. We were so unlucky that we used a bus that didnâ€™t stop until Cibubur. Man, we lost so far away. Because of that I gave up and we decided to use GoCar to go directly to the Shopee office. It made us paid a lot but I didnâ€™t have any choice.

When we arrived there, we still had so much time to print our CVs. That time, I thought we could make it on time. But because we lost time so much while finding musholla or mosque and place to print our CVs, we were late to the interview session. We walked too far from the Shopee office just to find musholla and place to print our CVs. Because the time of my interview session was near, I used GoRide to directly to the Shopee office. I was so panic and lost my mouth mask. I paid the driver again while actually Rifqy already paid via GoPay. I should be the first person to be interviewed, and then Rifqy and the last one was Raihan, thatâ€™s why I went there first while they were still busy printing their own CVs.

Inside the building, I just learned that it wasnâ€™t just for Shopee. I had to give my ID card to get the access card and the access card was only for going to Shopee office. I did well in the interview session although I thought I was still fucked up because I was late. After me, Rifqy was interviewed and the last one was Raihan.

After the interview sessions were finished, we went to the near food festival and ate fried rice. We guessed how much the fried rice but no one of us were right. I couldnâ€™t believe myself too because the fried rice was not as expensive as we thought.

Finally, with too many disappointments inside me, we were going back to Primajasa pool. Because no one of us knew how to go there, we believed on Google Maps. We used some Transjakarta minibuses and ran to the pool. Luckily, we got the last bus and could go back to Jatinangor.

My bad luck wasnâ€™t ended till there. When we arrived in Jatinangor, we used a public car to go to the campus and walked to Raihanâ€™s temporary home to take a motorcycle to bring me back to my place. I was so tired that I couldnâ€™t feel my feet anymore. And then, in the morning I was fucked up again because I was overslept and didnâ€™t join the presentation with my Cryptography team ðŸ˜­ That presentation should be the final score of Cryptography course. Because of that, I had to deal with the lecturer that I didnâ€™t like since he was so moody.
