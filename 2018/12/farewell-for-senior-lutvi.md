# Farewell for Senior Lutvi

Senior Lutvi was came to Padjadjaran University‚Äôs Informatics major because she got a student exchange program. She came from Hasanuddin University in South Sulawesi. This program made her went to a really far place from her residence and I thought she was awesome because she could adapt in a new place easily.

She was a good person. I knew her from the Artificial Intelligence‚Äôs Capita Selecta subject. She was alone at that time because there wasn‚Äôt any female student in that class and I didn‚Äôt go to the first meeting of the class. Some friends from my gang suggested me to befriend her because there would be a team work project in the class. Luckily, I could befriend her easily even though she was a year older than me (I mean the generation year here). I called her Senior Lutvi which was ‚ÄúTeh Lutvi‚Äù in Sundanese. I knew she didn‚Äôt understand Sundanese but still I couldn‚Äôt call people who were older than me without any respectable nickname üôÅ

Actually in the next week Senior Stacy joined and because I felt pity with her so I asked her too to join with my team. And then in the other next week, Shofi and Niya joined too in this class so finally there were 4 female students in this class. This subject was mandatory for 7th semester students but all 5th semester students who took Artificial Intelligence as the interest could take it earlier. My friends and I joined this semester because in the next year we didn‚Äôt want to have a lot of subjects to finish and we were trapped in Senior Umar‚Äôs lure about how easily we could get an A for this subject.

She was also in the Computer Graphics subject but because the teams for projects were chosen randomly so I couldn‚Äôt be together with her again. Not only that but we met too in Interpersonal Skills subject which was for 7th semester students and I took it earlier. But I kept talking with her because I didn‚Äôt want her to be ignored in her student exchange program. I heard she were also taking other subjects which were for 3rd semester students. So basically everyone from 3rd, 5th, and 7th semester Informatics students knew her but not everyone wanted to befriend her.

That‚Äôs all I could tell about her. Today the Artificial Intelligence‚Äôs Capita Selecta subject members were having a farewell party for her. It was Senior Umar‚Äôs idea and he asked me to gather all class members to celebrate it. We were having the party in Wake Up restaurant and I was the last person who got there. Not every class member came because some of them had their agenda or already went back home but we were already having fun there.

We played Uno card game and truth or dare game. The person who lost would get truth or dare questions from other winning players. In the first round Senior Fazlur lost and the second round I lost. Ah yes I forgot. After that we also played undercover game with Senior Ojan and Achun as the new players. They both weren‚Äôt the class members but they had their own agenda in the same place at that time. We played some rounds and then we took some photos together.

I think it wasn‚Äôt the best farewell party for her but I really hope the best for her. She said she would go back to her place on January next year after getting all scores of all subjects she took. Safe flight and please keep in touch with us!
