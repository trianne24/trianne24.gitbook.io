# Rock Bottom+ Party

oday Rifqy, Raihan, and me planned to have a thanksgiving party\(?\) for Iyon and Faizin because they had already helped us when we were struggling for [GEMASTIK 11 competition](../11/gemastik-11.md). Iyon helped us making the video about problems using any kind of social medias and also being the model too in that video LOL. Faizin helped us making the app in Android Studio. Although it was not asked in the competition but it was very useful to use in demo that day. Without them, I didn’t know my team could win or not.

As I told in the post about GEMASTIK 11, my team asked Iyon and Faizin because we were told from Mrs. Mira that we could add new ghost members to the team. Even though it was true in University of Indonesia but unfortunately it wasn’t occured in Padjadjaran University. Iyon and Faizin couldn’t join us in Surabaya. They even didn’t get anything from the university. That’s why we held this party to thank them.

We went to Pizza Hut in Jatinangor Town Square on night even though we didn’t have any class again because we still had some final projects to finish. We bought two big pans of pizzas, a bunch of snacks which I forgot the name of it, and a jar of lemon tea as you can see on the picture. Fyi, one of the pizzas was made almost 100% in cheese and we even ordered it with extra cheese LOL. While waiting the orders, we played a color spin game. The colors had their own meaning. I didn’t remember them all but there were flirting dare, answering truth questions, being free from the game, ordering someone to dare, and many more. The funniest moment in this game was everyone had ever gotten the color to flirt me because there wasn’t any female again to flirt in this party. I also got it once and chose to flirt Iyon because he sat beside me. When the orders were ready, we still played the game and ate at the same time.

The pizzas didn’t run out yet but we were already too full. Rifqy and Iyon brought the leftovers. Before going home, we took photos together. Rifqy and Iyon came to Jatos and went back to Iyon’s temporary home by walking. At first I came with Raihan’s motorcycle but because there were Rifqy and Iyon who walked so I followed them. Iyon’s temporary home was near with mine so I still had friends to talk while walking went back to my temporary home.
