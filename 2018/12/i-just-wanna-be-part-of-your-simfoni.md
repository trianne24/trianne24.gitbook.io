# I Just Wanna Be Part Of Your Simfoni!

This great deliberation will be my last great deliberation since I’m not interested in joining organizations anymore. There wasn’t anything special from this great deliberation, but I could tell that our bureau and almost all of the other bureaus and departments in Symphony Cabinet were lucky enough we didn’t have to spend a lot of time in the QnA session. I could go back early and enjoyed my night. The next day I was told that my bureau got a very good score. Woohoo! Thanks to Reynaldi, Abie, Tivani, and Harris we could make this real. Here’s some photos of me and all of the members of media and information bureau.
