# My Last Gathering in Misiologi

Today might be the last day I gathered with my Misiologi family because I had already planned to be free from any internal organizations. In the afternoon, the Christian Students Community of Misiologi organization members were gathered in Jonas Photo Studio. Here are some photos that we took there. Well damn I just remembered that I hadnâ€™t taken my printed photo yet ðŸ˜‘

The waiting time to the photo session was longer than the photo session itself. After that, I actually wanted to run away by going home by myself and skipped the dinner together time. But because my division wanted to take a photo in a photobooth (like a purikura) so I cancelled my runaway attempt. Since we had to wait to take the photos so we went to the dinner place to put our bags. The place, which was in Geprek Bensu, was next to Jonas Photo Studio so we only had to walk for a moment. That time was so awkward. I knew every name of the members but I barely knew anything about them. After that, we were going to Jonas Photo Studio again and taking the photos. Here are the photos from the photobooth.

While my division were coming back to Geprek Bensu, the others had already done eaten and talked about serious things. That time, Senior Dora, who was the president of Misiologi this year, was talking about how unworthy we were because we chose other organizations and committeesâ€™ business rather than chose service to God. I felt that she was true but I didnâ€™t like how she said that we were unworthy. Nobody was unworthy. We should realize it by ourselves, not because the president said we were unworthy. I wasnâ€™t lying but Senior Dora talked about that and she cried. Rather than being emotional, I felt nothing toward her. The only reason I was still in Misiologi was because Senior Yoan. I didnâ€™t know that I had said this before but when I heard Senior Dora was chosen to be the president, I refused to join this organization anymore. I once had a bad memory toward Senior Dora before so I just didnâ€™t like when she had to be the president while I knew some other people that could be the president. At that time, I also felt sad because of my rotten generation so yeah I would like to empty my mind.

But thanks to this dinner time, I made a friend with Josua. It was awkward before but at the end we could talk as we were known each other for a long time. I actually didnâ€™t understand why he was interested at me. Later, in the future, I knew maybe he sensed that I was going to be the most outstanding student candidate. Well I was only chosen for my department but he was chosen for his faculty so he was on the higher level haha. Anyway, this was only my opinion. I seriously didnâ€™t know why he wanted to talk to me at that time.
