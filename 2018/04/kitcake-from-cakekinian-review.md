# KitCake from Cakekinian Review

In this time, who doesn’t know Cakekinian? I have to admit that Cakekinian was the best celeb’s cakes in Indonesia. The flavor and the name of the cakes are different from others. Other celeb’s cakes only have original flavors such as chocolate, cheese, strawberry, vanilla, etc. But Cakekinian cakes have unique flavors such as Oreo, Kitkat, Beng-beng, Marie biscuits, and many more.

I bought Kitcake which was Cakekinian in green tea Kitkat flavor from Technopreneur. At that time, Technopreneur’s fundraising division opened a pre order for Cakekinian cakes. Honestly, the price was not worth it for a small cake but it was still better than other celeb’s cakes I tried. The package was very cute. I love the plastic bag.

Here’s the picture of the Kitcake box. I was so greedy and didn’t even remember to capture the cake. Last words from me, just try it! Also, don’t forget to buy Technopreneur’s ticket!
