# My First TOEFL Preparation and Test

![](https://sites.unpad.ac.id/realicejoanne/wp-content/uploads/sites/21214/2018/04/cafe.jpg)

I really want to have TOEFL certification. TOEFL certification can make my CV cooler and also can help me find a certain scholarship. But this experience was really far from my expectations.

There was an announcement from Padjadjaran‚Äôs Students Council about a TOEFL preparation and test from Zambert company. I thought the price was also not expensive so I invited some people especially Senior Ojan to join this.

The day of the preparation was come. I had to admit the presentation was really fun and easy to understand. From the explanation I knew that there would be three parts which were listening part, reading part, and the last one was structure and written expression part. In the night I didn‚Äôt study anything and just sleep so I could wake up and ready for the test on time.

Finally today was come. I registered myself first then took a seat for the test. I chose to sit in the very front of the seats so I could listen well for the listening part. As I guessed the listening part wasn‚Äôt easy. Damn, it meant that I was still not compatible to study abroad üòï Luckily, for the other parts weren‚Äôt really difficult except the ‚Äúwhich is wrong‚Äù section. I almost couldn‚Äôt answer any questions in that section because every words looked already right.

Umm actually this story was edited okay. So after several days waiting for the TOEFL score, I got an announcement to take the certificate but I had to pay again üòü Damn, at first it looked not expensive but if it was included this certificate price I would say this was really bad. There was also another fact that I hated. The certificate was only valid for two years not forever. Yeah it looked rational but why only two years? Two years again I would be graduated and I had to take another TOEFL test again for searching a job. Again, I was really disappointed too when I heard that Himatif would have a TOEFL preparation and test too in the near time and the price was cheaper than this damn.

That was my story about having TOEFL test. Oh yes I didn‚Äôt mention my score. My score was 537. Not bad but also not really good. People said a minimum good score was above 550 if I wanted to take an international scholarship or apply job in international company.
