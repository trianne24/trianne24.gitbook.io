# DIY Gifts For Male?

Senior Ojan was having his birthday on March 3rd and I will have my birthday on June 24th. We were planning to give each other a birthday gift on the middle date of our birthdays. If I wasn’t wrong, the date should be last week but because there were some activities and problems so it was postponed. And finally I gave him the birthday gift that I made by myself today. But he didn’t give me anything. Well it’s okay because several days ago he gave me an earphone although he didn’t say that it was for my birthday gift.

I had my own struggles about what to give to him for a birthday gift. Seriously, I didn’t know what should I give to a boyfriend. I knew I could give him belt, tie, or even a new sweater but I thought he already had one. I wanted to give something that he didn’t have and he would use it for a long time. Also, I wanted him to remember me when he used the gift I gave.

After thinking so hard about it, I desperately chose to give him a DIY gift. I made him a photos roll which was look like a film roll and a polaroid camera which contained our photos from photobox. I made them all just with creative papers. Not only those but I also gave him a nail clipper which I put in the DIY envelope from the leftovers of the creative papers because I knew he never cut his nails and his nails were so annoying for me. I thought the nail clipper was the only one real gift I gave to him. I knew it was cheap and not as expensive as the earphone he gave to me but I really wished he accepted it with all of his heart.
