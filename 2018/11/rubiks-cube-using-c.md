# Rubik’s Cube using C\#

Computer Graphics was one of the courses I took this semester and had a final project to do. Mr. Arif, the lecturer of this course, let his students to choose what to do for the final score. There were three options: making a tutorial video about EmguCV, making a computer graphics project, and doing a final test. I chose the second option because I thought it would be the easiest since I could find any open source projects from Github. Thanks to [lucassklp](https://github.com/lucassklp/RubikCube) for the repository about making Rubik’s cube using C#. Here’s the screenshot of the project and you could see the source code in my Github account [here](https://github.com/realicejoanne/grafkom-project).
