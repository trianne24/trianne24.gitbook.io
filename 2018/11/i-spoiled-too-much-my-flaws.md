# I Spoiled Too Much My Flaws

Christian of Informatics (CoI) was a community of Christians in Padjadjaran University’s Informatics department. It was officially started last year with the retreat event like this. We could say this year was our first anniversary of CoI and we celebrated it with a retreat event again. We took the same place like last year’s. The retreat event was held for 1 day and 2 nights.

On Friday noon, we went to the villa and prepared our dinner. We also had a sharing session. In this sharing session I told everyone that I still couldn’t find any church who was suitable with me. Some of the churches I tried to go made me sleepy. I didn’t want to go to church anymore if I went there just to make myself bad in front of God. Some people advised me and to be honest I was so stupid why I shared my flaws there -\_- But at least I could find peace because of them.

The next day, we had a game session hosted by Senior Evita and Senior Yoshe. The participants were split into two teams. My team didn’t win but we still enjoyed the winner prize together with the winning team. We also took the photos together.

At night, we didn’t have a serious sharing session again like yesterday but we watched a movie. I forgot the title of the movie but it was kinda religious because it was related to God. The plot was about a God who was staying on a bar and met people who lost in their trip. After that we went to sleep.

The next morning, we didn’t have any thing to do. We took our last lunch together and prepared to go back to our place. We also took photos again together. This time, we already took a bath so we were so refreshed rather than yesterday’s photos. I forgot to say but yesterday we were forced to do the game session just after we woke up. We didn’t even have breakfast before.

After that we went back to our place. Our last stop was in campus again but because I was on the same way back like Senior Yoshe who drove her own car, I was brought until I arrived in front of my place LOL. To be honest, I couldn’t think if next year’s retreat event would be any better like this year’s.
