# CIMB 3D Conquest

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/images (5).jpg>)

This competition was recommended by one of my lecturers who wasn’t teaching me this semester and some seniors from 2015 generation were interested to join it. I was asked by Senior Alwan to be in his team, along with Senior Bob and Senior Ojan. We chose to join the Fintech category which let the participants thought an idea whether it’s an app, system, or anything that could be new and unique about fintech. My team name was PadjadjaranTech and the leader was Senior Alwan. Every time we would like to discuss for this competition, we did it in Senior Alwan’s room. I could go to there easily because Senior Alwan lived beside my temporary home.

Our idea was making an app dedicated to parents and kids. As parents, they could easily give allowance to their kids with e-money. As kids, they could spend their money and at the same time could play games inside to get more money to save. Unfortunately, this idea was only survived to the second stage. We couldn’t make into final stage. But we were happy to join this kind of competition and maybe we would like to try again next time.
