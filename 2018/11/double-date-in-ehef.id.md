# Double Date in EHEF.ID?

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/images (4).jpg>)

EHEF.ID was the name of the event that I went today with Senior Bob, Senior Piya, and Senior Ojan. This event was annually held but unlike Tech in Asia, this event was not only in one city but some big cities in Indonesia. I went to EHEF.ID in Bandung with them by Senior Piya’s car. The venue of EHEF.ID in Bandung was in Sabuga. That place was so small. I didn’t expect people who came to the venue would be so many. I guessed this event was popular huh? I couldn’t use this chance to collect freebies and flyers as usual since I didn’t like to argue with people. I only could talk with some campus stands randomly. I didn’t have chance to ask if they had artificial intelligence or design course in each stand. At least I left my name and e-mail in some visitor forms of each stand I had chance to talk.

I didn’t spend a lot of time there. After being exhausted because the place was so hot and very small, I went outside and bought durian ice cream. Dudeee, the price is irrational but I didn’t have any choice because I need something cold! After seeing me bought the ice cream, Senior Bob and Senior Ojan bought it too. We were waiting Senior Piya who was being with her friend there and finally we were going back to our place.
