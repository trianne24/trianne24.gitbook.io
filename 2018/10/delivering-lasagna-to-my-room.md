# Delivering Lasagna to My Room

I followed Tolongin delivery service for a long time in LINE. Sometimes I took a look to what they broadcasted to me. There’s one that made me interested a lot. The restaurant’s name is Kedai Dedoet. I stalked into its Instagram account and they shared the location of the restaurant. But somehow, I couldn’t find the exact location of that restaurant even though I always went through that way if I went home from the university. So I decided to use Tolongin delivery service to get the foods I wanted from that restaurant.

[Kedai Dedoet](https://www.instagram.com/kedai\_dedoet/) served some delicious foods. Most of them are sweets, such as strudels, pastries, brownies choco lava cake, cheese rolls, choco mount cake and banana geprek (I think it’s kinda similar to banana nuggets). There were also mango sticky rice, zuppa soup, and lasagna. I asked Tolongin to deliver zuppa soup and beef lasagna to my temporary home.

Tolongin is super duper reliable. They delivered as fast as possible even though I actually hated how this and every online-but-not-via-application delivery service in Jatinangor worked. I only had used this kind of delivery service twice. One for delivering fried rice from Rahayu, which I loved a lot but it’s difficult to get it since I had to get there by myself, and the second one was for delivering Kedai Dedoet’s foods. I couldn’t help myself to get fried rice from Rahayu at that time. Because Rahayu didn’t collaborate with any delivery service including GoFood and GrabFood, I didn’t have any choice but to order it from online-but-not-via-application delivery service. I forgot which delivery service I used but I was sure it wasn’t Tolongin. Although it’s not Tolongin, but the way they delivered it was as same as the other one. I hated how they asked for my personal information like my name and my phone number. Well, it’s not very hurtful but I just didn’t like when the driver contacted my phone number via Whatsapp. You know, you had to add the person first before you could contact him/her. That’s why I felt so unsecured because they had my phone number in their phone even though I didn’t know who’s the driver. It’s okay if it’s me because nobody would like a woman like me but that way would let them to get other pretty women’s number and where they lived. Damn, that’s unfair. That’s my review about that kind of delivery service. If that’s not for Rahayu and Kedai Dedoet, I wouldn’t like to try to use that delivery service anymore. It’s not effective because they didn’t track the history of their customers and it’s very unsecured to share your phone number to strangers.

How about Kedai Dedoet’s foods? The price of the foods were not cheap but not too expensive. I enjoyed every bite of the foods I ordered. To be honest, even though I liked it, I didn’t want to order it again because the difficulty of getting the foods. They didn’t collaborate with delivery services in application like GoFood and GrabFood and only collaborate with those stupid online delivery services I reviewed before. I believed if they used delivery services in application, they would get more customers rather than relied on the online-but-not-via-application delivery services. I wish they will collaborate with GoFood and GrabFood sooner to make helpless creatures who don’t have vehicles to go there like me happy.
