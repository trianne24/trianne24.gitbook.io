# August Notes

Hey ya, I will sum all the stories of this August in one post. The main reason is I didn’t have time to handle my blog this month \*sigh. Also I was so tired with everything that happened this month. Let’s start the story, shall we?

Just so you know, I was chosen as the head of the publication and documentation division in Character Building Season 2018. That seasonal event will be held at the beginning of the new semester. It’s not like I don’t like this position but I just can’t reject it. After all, those scandalous people who didn’t like me (referred to [this post](../../2017/12/gloomy-week.md)) wouldn’t choose me as the head of the design division in IFest 2018. Ah seriously I don’t want to hold my grudge anymore. This is a professional blog and I should be professional. No hard feelings! I know those memories were the worst but let’s expect what will be the best for me.

Umm okay, maybe some of the people don’t know why I talked weirdly before. I forgot to tell in that gloomy post that somehow I actually knew that I wouldn’t be chosen as the head of media and information bureau so I begged Alif. If I wasn’t chosen, I would like to be the head of the design division in IFest 2018. I would like to make revolutions for IFest 2018 because I believed that some of the failures IFest 2017 did were mostly from the design division. Seriously I hated to see that Alif said he couldn’t let me be the head of the design division in IFest 2018 because the project officer. I won’t say his name because it makes me want to throw up by thinking that useless guy.

Back to the topic, the reason I couldn’t reject that high position in Character Building Season 2018 was because I wanted some of my friends in Cyber generation to know that I could contribute and make everything better from design perspectives. If I was rejected in IFest, then I would prove it in CBS even though I didn’t like the memories of working in CBS last year. Last year, I worked as a medic staff and the worst of all, being the daily division manager on the last day of CBS. I hated to work up a lot. But if I reject this, I won’t have any chance again to show off myself. So yeah, keep the spirit up Pat!

At first, I thought I would be strong. Then everything changed when Radit, the project officer of CBS 2018, said that the core committee members should hold the core meeting twice a week, even in the holiday months like this August. Whatt? You couldn’t be more serious. Of course I wouldn’t tell my parents about this condition or they would be mad. At the same time, I also wanted to make some excuses so that I could run away from the meetings. The meetings weren’t always showing any progress. So I tried to run away with some excuses but kept being responsible at the same time. There was one time when I was caught up by Teguh because I was walking alone on the street and Teguh saw me while he was riding his motorcycle to the meeting point. I begged Teguh for not telling the others my presence by saying I was walking there to go to Fajar’s temporary home to get back my old laptop and then directly went back home again to Jakarta after that. Actually I wasn’t really lying because I was really going to Fajar’s temporary home but I didn’t go back home again to Jakarta. Jeez, I’m telling this like it was a very unforgivable sin. I only skipped some meetings until I felt that I was ready again to face reality. I promise myself it won’t happen again in the next few months even until CBS is started.

In August, I also went to Maker Fest in Bandung. This festival was held on August 4-5, 2018 by Tokopedia. I could go inside for free. Too bad I didn’t have some pics to share here. This festival was a good place for some creative industries like hand crafts, arts, fashions, etc. to show off their products and of course to sell them. I went there with Senior Ojan, Zaenal, and Zaenal’s friend. I didn’t spend anything there and we only took a look at the festival not for a long time.

Back again about CBS since this month is all about CBS preparations. This month I was so energetic yet so tired because of the posting schedule. Fyi, there is an official account made in LINE@ for CBS 2018 information and activities. I could say this job would be one of my best design feeds in my portfolio. I only let my members handle print designs but I didn’t want my members to ruin my plan in publication designs. Ah yes I also have to say thanks to Ilham for the logo design because I am bad at logo designing. I have to admit Ilham is super skilled in designing by seeing the logo that he created. I never thought an E logo would be as pretty as Eclipse logo. Eclipse is the name of the freshmen’s generation that will be the participants of this year’s CBS. I had Ihza too as my staff along with Ilham but I thought Ihza would be good for documentation jobs later.

I thought that’s all I could write for this month. If I talk too much about CBS here, then I don’t know what to write anymore on the last day of CBS 2018 LOL.
