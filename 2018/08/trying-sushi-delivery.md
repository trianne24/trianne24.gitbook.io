# Trying Sushi Delivery

I feel bored with any kind of food in Jatinangor that time. Then I remembered that several days ago Mila bought sushi and since she couldn’t finish it she gave the rest of the sushi to me. I asked Mila the contact of that sushi kiosk and she directly gave it to me along with the menu as well. So the sushi kiosk is located in Ciseke but I don’t know the name of the kiosk. I would call it Sushi Ciseke only.

I bought the yakizu roll menu. The delivery was free and it didn’t take a long time to wait for it. This yakizu roll menu has 8 pieces of sushi with chicken katsu, chicken teriyaki, nori and mayonnaise sauce on them. The price is also quite cheap. Actually I chose this menu because this is one of the cheapest menu LOL.

I can say I would like to buy from Sushi Ciseke again next time. Although this menu is not recommended for an empty stomach since it’s not filling up the tummy. In the end, I bought another snack type food rather than carbohydrates. I asked Mila, who was in Jatos at that time, to buy crepes in Jatos for me. Seriously Pat you need to stop!
