# Fresh Look of My Old Laptop

 It’s true that I have got a new laptop because my old laptop was very uncomfortable. But I still don’t get rid the old laptop. My father insisted to fix the old laptop at least the interface so that my little sisters could use it or he could sell it with a good price. So I asked Fajar to paint my old laptop. It was hard to get the spray pylox paint so I bought it online. I left my laptop with Fajar and in the end of the last semester I took it back. Too bad my father didn’t like the new look and asked me to add transparent paint too for the old laptop so it would shine. Lucky me I had the old transparent color spray pylox paint that I once bought for my school project in high school. But I hate to say this, because of this I had to bring again the laptop to Fajar and bring it back again next semester. I felt bad too to Fajar because I didn’t pay for it since we were friends. My father said, “Friends shouldn’t ask for payment”. Although he said that, I still paid Fajar because I didn’t want Fajar hated me because I was too stingy. So far the new look of my old laptop was like the picture below. But yeah, in the next semester I should bring it again and I hope my father will accept it.
